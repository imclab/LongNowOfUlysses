## Seminar Discussion

Discuss: Besser, [“The Past, Present, and Future of Digital Libraries”](http://nora.lis.uiuc.edu:3030/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405103213/9781405103213.xml&chunk.id=ss1-5-6); Brown, Clements, and Grundy, [“Going Electronic”](http://orlando.cambridge.org/public/svDocumentation?formname=t&d_id=GOINGELECTRONIC); Unsworth, [“Scholarly Primitives: What Methods Do Humanities Researchers Have in Common, and How Might our Tools Reflect This?”](http://people.lis.illinois.edu/~unsworth/Kings.5-00/primitives.html); Bowker and Star, from [*Sorting Things Out*](http://books.google.ca/books/about/Sorting_Things_Out.html?id=xHlP8WqzizYC); and Balsamo, from [*Designing Culture*](http://books.google.ca/books?id=_BsQudpHXn4C&source=gbs_navlinks_s)

In these readings, what are the differences and overlaps between design, metadata, "scholarly primitives," standards, and classifications? How and when do these differences and overlaps matter? 

## Example Data Models (for Data-Driven Expression) 

* [Spreadsheet Mapper 2.0](http://www.google.com/earth/outreach/tutorials/spreadsheet.html)
* [TimelineJS](http://timeline.verite.co/) 

## Things to Remember When Producing Data Models 

* Do not use apps or readymade models that do not allow you to export your data.  
* Ideally, your project exports in a variety of light-weight, non-proprietary formats (XML, TXT).  
* Whenever possible, keep data separate from expression (e.g., a spreadsheet distinct from a visualization). 
* When soliciting responses from a group, consider a data entry form (as opposed to giving people direct access to your data). 
* Often, existing models, ontologies, and standards need to be mashed together for domain-specific work.   
* Sustainable models correspond with existing standards and conventions (e.g., DCMI).
