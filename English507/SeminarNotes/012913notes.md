## Good Practice According to the NINCH Guide 

If and when you have a moment, I recommend perusing the [NINCH Guide to Good Practice](http://www.nyu.edu/its/pubs/pdfs/NINCH_Guide_to_Good_Practice.pdf).

According to the Guide, practice will: 
1. Optimize interoperability of materials. (Digitization projects should enable the optimal interoperability between source materials from different repositories or digitization projects.)
2. Enable broadest use. (Projects should enable multiple and diverse uses of material by multiple 
and diverse audiences.)
3. Address the need for the preservation of original materials. (Projects should incorporate procedures to address the preservation of original materials.)
4. Indicate strategy for life-cycle management of digital resources. (Projects should plan for the life-cycle management of digital resources, including the initial assessment of resources, selection of materials and digital rights management; the technical questions of digitizing all formats; and the long-term issues of sustainability, user assessment, digital asset management and preservation.)
5. Investigate and declare intellectual property rights and ownership. (Ownership and rights issues need to be investigated before digitization commences and findings should be reported to users.)
6. Articulate intent and declare methodology. (All relevant methods, perspectives and assumptions used by project staff should be clarified and made explicit.)

The Guide also prompts practitioners to ask questions such as: 

* Where is the audience for my collections?
* What types of individuals does that audience include?
* Will digitization enable me to meet the needs of existing communities better?
* Will digitization enable me to create new audiences for both the digital surrogates and the analog
sources?
* What do I mean by “audience” in the digital world? Am I referring only to those individuals to whom I can
deliver digital materials or am I also giving consideration to those who would like to produce digital surrogates for business, personal and research purposes?
* What are the aims of the digitization project or program and how can these guide selection, in cases where limited resources prevent you from digitizing the whole collection?
* How do these issues apply to material created in digital form?
* Who will be using these resources?
* What are their needs?
* Do the collections you selected for digitization need special handling?
* What are their characteristics and how do these affect the digitization process?

## Revising the NINCH Guide for Our Purposes

Since our literary exhibit is only in part a digitization effort, I propose revising the above questions to ask the following questions of the exhibit's various components: 

* Where is the audience for our exhibit? 
* Who does that audience included? Who does it exclude (or risk excluding)? 
* Will remediation (or, if you prefer, intermediation) allow us to better meet the needs and interests of specific communities? If so, then who are those communities? 
* What do we mean by "audience" in distributed environments, across on- and offline interactions? 
* What are the aims of our literary exhibit and how can these aims guide its design and modes of communication, interpretation, and persuasion? 
* When asked by community members, how can we best justify what is being included in the exhibit? Even at this early stage of development, what gaps exist in both content and design? 
* In, say, five years, who will be accessing and using materials from the exhibit? 
* What might be the needs and interests of those future audiences? Aside from needs and interests, what else should we anticipate or consider? 
* What are the various material characteristics of the objects we are presenting? How do they affect people's various understandings of digital culture as well as the digital humanities? 
* How should people occupy our exhibit? Or, how do we want them to occupy it, and to what effects on popular perceptions of both literature and curation? 
* And finally, with respect to the long now of things, two more important questions: 

## How Do We Present Histories of Multifarious Futures?   

"If we are to learn from artists who have opted to play the risky game of seeking to sensitize us for the other through and with advanced technology, then gradually we must begin to turn around what is familiar. When the spaces for action become ever smaller for all that is unwieldy or does not entirely fit in, that is unfamiliar and foreign, then we must attempt to confront the possible with its own impossibilities, thus rendering it more inspiring and worth experiencing. We must also seek a reversal with respect to time, which---in an era characterized by high-speed technologies and their permeation of teaching, research, and design---has arguably become the most prized commodity of all. These excursions into the deep time of the media do not make any attempt to expand the present nor do they contain any plea for slowing the pace. The goal is to uncover dynamic moments in the media-archaeological record that abound and revel in heterogeneity and, in this way, to enter into a relationship of tension with various present-day moments, relativize them, and render them more decisive." Siegfried Zielinski, *Deep Time of the Media* (11) 

In many ways, both Zielinski's work and the question above demand an exhibit that avoids kitsch nostalgia ([see Trettien](http://blog.whitneyannetrettien.com/2013/01/circuit-bending-digital-humanities.html), hip retro-futurism, linear narratives, and well-packaged retrospectives. 

And . . . 

## How Do We Highlight the Ways Our Materials Endure by Resisting Interpretation? 

"What I am advancing is a media-critical antiquarianism. There has always been a double bind in antiquarian data processing between distance and empathy, resulting from the gap between the physical presence and the discursive absence of the past. Antiquarians have tried to bridge this gap by touching and tasting the immediate, material object. For antiquarians, history is not just text but the materialist emancipation of the object from an exclusive subjection to textual analysis. Antiquarianism acknowledges the past as artifactual hardware, so to speak, upon which historical discourse operates like a form of software. In a digital culture of apparent, virtual, immaterial realities, a reminder of the insistence and resistance of material worlds is indispensable, and all the more so from a media-theoretical point of view." Wolfgang Ernst, *Digital Memory and the Archive* (43) 

These kinds of questions, in tandem with Ernst's work, beg for approaches that do not reduce what's in our exhibit to either a mere documentation of history or a tidy historical narrative. Instead, we might take up the challenge of presenting the exhibit as an active production of historical imagination (e.g., through the arrangement of materials and the juxtaposition of data) open to various configurations.
