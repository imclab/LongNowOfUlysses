## Key Moments in Ramsay's "Algorithmic Criticism"

* "Literary critical interpretation is not just a qualitative matter, but an insistently subjective manner of engagement."

* "We can uncover those distinctions by reading carefully. We can also uncover them using a computer."
 
* "We might want to say that the purpose of these procedures is to confirm or deny the 'serendipitous reading' of literary critics." 
 
* "We would do better to recognize that a scientific literary criticism would cease to be criticism."

* "Algorithmic criticism would have to retain the commitment to methodological rigor demanded by its tools, but the emphasis would be less on maintaining a correspondence or a fitness between method and goal, and more on the need to present methods in a fully transparent manner." 

## Key Moments in "Deformance and Interpretation" by McGann and Samuels

* "Deformance does want to show that the poem's intelligibility is not a function of the interpretation but that all interpretation is a function of the poem's systemic intelligibility. Interpreting a poem after it has been deformed clarifies the secondary status of the interpretation."  

* "Our deformations do not flee from the question, or the generation, of meaning. Rather, they try to demonstrate --- the way one demonstrates how to make something, or do something --- what Blake here assertively proposes: that meaning in imaginative work is a secondary phenomenon, a kind of meta-data, what Blake called a form of worship 'Dependent' upon some primary poetical tale." 

* "'Meaning' is important not as explanation but as residue. It was what is left behind after the experiment has been run. We develop it not to explain the poem but to judge the effectiveness of the experiment we undertook."

## Key Moments in Moretti's Descriptions of Distant Reading: 

* "That's the point: world literature is not an object, it's a problem, and a problem that asks for a new critical method: and no one has ever found a method by just reading more texts."

* "Distant reading: where distance, let me repeat it, is a condition of knowledge: it allows you to focus on units that are much smaller or much larger than the text: devices, themes, tropes---or genres and systems."  

* "Trees and branches are what nation-states cling to; waves are what markets do."  

## Key Moments in Manovich's Cultural Analytics: 

* "The data sets will come from two main sources. The first source is media content - games / visual design / music / videos / photos / art / blogs / web pages, etc. In visualizing this content, we will use not only already existing metadata (such as image tags created by the users) but also new metadata which we will generate by analysing the media content (for instance, image processing of Flickr images). The second source is digital traces left when people discuss, create, publish, consume, share, edit, and remix these media."

* "We feel that the ground has been set to start thinking of culture as data (including media content and people’s creative and social activities around this content) that can be mined and visualized." 

* Imagine the same wall-sized display divided into multiple frames, each showing different data about cultural, social, and economic news and trends – thus providing a situational awareness for cultural analysts."

## Algorithms are Thoughts, Chainsaws are Tools, by Ramsay

## Tool Analysis

Select one of the following: ManyEyes, Voyant, Sitesucker, Exhibit 3.0, or visual.ly

Start by acknowledging the following problem or issue: through these tools, theory is erased by use.  

Be sure to note the specs of your operating system and browser, at least. 

Next: 

* Use demos; find out how it's been used in specific projects.
* Where applicable, install it and run it. 
* Take screengrabs. 
* Report back with responses to the following questions:  

** What does it do? 
** What questions can I ask? 
** What questions can I not ask? 
** What do I see?
** What do I not see? 
** How could this tool surprise me? 
** How could this tool reduce the likelihood of surprise? 
** Can I break it? How?
