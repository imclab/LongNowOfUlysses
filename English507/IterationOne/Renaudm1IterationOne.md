## Documentation: Research on Existing Max Projects

Example of project by [Melanie MÃ¶ller](http://www.melaniemoellerproductions.com/) that reads audience input to control output:
[Visual Space: Motion-based interactive installation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44C15RXux3Q)

Explanation of Process:

"Visual Space is an interactive system, which uses motion tracking technology to enable users to control video clips, visual effects and sound through hand, head and shoulder movement. The position of different limbs is detected via a Microsoft Xbox Kinect. Tracking data are extracted in Processing and manipulated in Max/MSP Jitter. The application features a customisable interface that allows loading in videos and sound files as well as to select effects. Clips and visual effects can be deselected, changed or linked to different joints at any time. Therefore, Visual Space facilitates motion controlled video mixing in real time, allows for numerous modes of interaction and can be easily customised. I developed this project as part of my MSc in Creative Technologies at De Montfort University, Leicester."

"PulseCubes - interactive sound installation demo

PulseCubes is an interactive sound installation. Visitors are invited to become part of an implicit feedback loop whose other components include a set of small cubes on a flat surface, computer vision and digital signal processing. The cubes are tracked by a web camera positioned overhead and processed through a partially opaque system implemented in the programming environment Max/MSP/Jitter. Audience interaction is created through the placement and movements of these cubes acting as a control device which in turn results in the production of audio and physical vibrations.

PulseCubes was part of The Dissolving Cube at the Portman Gallery, London in Nov-Dec 2009, re:new Digital Arts Festival, Copenhagen in May 2010 and Sound Travels Festival of Sound Art, Toronto in Aug 2012."
	
	
## Draft Component (in working or iterative form)

* Sample Library so far, focusing on Joyce historical recordings.
* Demo Hamel Max/Patch "Sample Player Test"

## Three Specific Questions for the Group:
	
	1 - How would you prefer to experience an exhibit, with independently with headphones 
		or speakers installed in the space? Why?
	2 - If you are in an exhibit that's reacting to you in some manner, how visible would 	
		you like its processes to be? Do you want to see the man behind the curtain?
	3 - How distracting would you find recorded text within an exhibit?


## List three things that have gone wrong, surprised you, or the like.

	1 -  I've been startled by my reaction to data-modelling and some of the points dealing 		with 
		systematization of working process. In my artistic practice as a composer, I've endlessly envied 
		artist's with visual based practices as they seem to have a much cleaner workflow. For example 
		thinking about Gerhard Richter who tells his assistants two weeks in advance that he'll be coming 
		into the studio to paint and what colours etc he wants. They prepare his materials and he comes in 
		and paints. I've found myself pushing back against my own attempts to better clarify my working 
		processes ahead of time to the point of having to step back from the project for a couple of weeks to 
		clear my head. I think it's a matter more of adapting to a new way of working and finding what points 
		I can build more flexibly in.


	2 -  Being my first time working in on an instillation, I've found myself moving between regarding the 
		project as a sort of archive, which I at times find less interesting, and thinking of it as a 
		instillation piece.
	 
	3 -  Quickly it is becoming apparent the I will have too build certain limits into the patch to control what 
		is playing at what time because multiple voices will be rather distracting and cacophonous. At the 
		same time though I want to make sure I don't remove all of the sense of play or interaction from the 		
		instillation.
