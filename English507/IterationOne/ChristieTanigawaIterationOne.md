### Project 1 Description
This portion of the project rethinks a linear progression of both space and time by situating Ulysses in a past and present Dublin. For the first segment, three [historical maps of Dublin](http://voyager.library.uvic.ca/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=2283456) from the UVic Library's Special collection, including a map of Dublin during the Anglo-Norman invasion that situates Ulysses’ Dublin in a long colonial history, an 1876 map, and a 1925 map that represents Dublin around the time of Ulysses’ publication, are layered over one another to give a sense of how the path of the novel translates through time. The project will also map objects in the exhibit that represent objects locateable in Ulysses’ Dublin in order to re-situate the dislocated objects in their geotemporal location as suggested by the novel. 

### Project 2 Description
The second component of the project represents the time spent in each place relative to the amount of time the novel is situated in specific areas of Dublin. Using a scanned image of Special Collection's 1925 Dublin map, we will 3D model the map using Mudbox to render the map malleable to distortion. We will then raise the topography of the map in proportion to the number of words locatable in a region in Dublin over the number of words in the novel (roughly 265,000).  To determine this proportional relation, the number of total words in the novel are divided by the number of words anchored in a specific area of Dublin.  
## Workflow for Project 1: 
* Locate historical maps of Dublin from Special Collection's archive
* select three historical maps to layer over Google Earth 
* scan the maps in sections using Vue Scan
* stich maps together using Photoshop
* layer the maps in Google Earth (adjust images accordingly) 
* select objects from exhibit acquisition list
** look specifically for objects that can be located in Dublin 
* take photos of exhibit objects
* locate the objects (latitude and longitude) in Dublin 
* create placemarks in Google Earth and link placemarks to images of exhibit objects
* using Google Earth API create a version that can work on an independent site

## Workflow of Project 2: 
* Determine height ratio by dividing the number of words locatable in a place with the total word count of Ulysses (roughly 265,000 words). 
* Stitch scanned images of historical map using Photoshop
* Create plane in Mudbox
* Overlap stitched map using Projection tool
* Use sculpt tool to deform plane (elevations represent larger temporal)
* Export movie of map using Render>Create Turntable Movie
* Export layer as .stl file for printing
* Print tactile map

## Questions: 
* Is there any value to seeing the historical context of Dublin? What changes can you see between the map layers? What changes can you not see or would like to see?
* How can we make this more user friendly and more of something that people get something... anything... out of?
* How do you see yourself interacting with the tactile map?
* Should the finished product be a screencast video of clicking through the maps? 

## Things that have gone wrong, were surprising, etc.: 
* Map Tac was not going to be ideal for the tactile geotemporality project.
* Working with Google Earth was not as difficult as I anticipated. 
* Ulysses is not always an easy text to pin to a geographical location.
* The projects kept evolving. 
* There are a lot of mapping tools out there.
