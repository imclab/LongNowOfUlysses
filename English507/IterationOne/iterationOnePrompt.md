# ITERATION ONE

Now's the time of the semester when can start circulating draft components of your project for our literary exhibit on "The Long of Now of *Ulysses*." The idea here is for you to receive feedback from your peers and me before you proceed with and complete the project in April.  

## LEARNING OUTCOMES  

For you to: 

* With others in 507, share a functioning "proof of concept" for your project. 
* Document some or all of your workflow for the project.  
* Get feedback on your project.  
* Revise how you are thinking about the project, including its outcomes.  

## WHAT YOU SHOULD INCLUDE IN YOUR RESPONSE 

For this iteration, please submit the following to the "IterationOne" directory in "English507": 

* Documentation of some or all of your workflow for the project, using text, images, video, or a combination of media to show others how this becomes that.  
* A draft component of your project, ideally in working or interactive form.  
* A revised needs assessment and outcomes statement. 
* Three specific questions you have for the group. 
* A list of at least three things that have gone wrong, surprised you, or the like.   

During seminar on March 5th, we will workshop these components of your project, with an emphasis on your questions and proof of concept. 

If you are submitting any dynamic media (e.g., video), then feel free to point to it from GitHub. For instance, you could upload it to Vimeo and then link to it via a file in our repo. Feel free to include images in the repo, too. There's no need to store them elsewhere, unless you want to.  

As for the revised needs assessment and outcomes statement, simply revise your existing submission (from a few weeks ago) and commit the changes. There's no need to submit a new file. When revising the file, please consider: 

* Making your outcomes much more concrete and specific.
* Refining with feasibility in mind. 
* Elaborating on materials and needs to reflect changes that have occurred this semester.     

Aside from the revised needs assessment and outcomes statement, all other files (markdown and images included) can go in the "IterationOne" directory. Please don't forget to include your name in all of the files related to your project.
