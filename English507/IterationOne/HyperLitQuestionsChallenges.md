# 3 Questions for the Group

1. Does the order of frames that we're presenting the app's functionality in make sense to you?
2. Can you list the activities and functionalities offered in HyperLit?
3. Is the critical framework we described today inherent in the demo of the app, or does it seem like just another app commodifying an activity?

# 3 Things that Went Wrong, Surprised Us, etc.

1. We were surprised by the limitations of Blasamiq. It seems to be a really useful and intuitive tool for the initial sketching of wireframes, making it easy to work through and play around with content buckets and information hierarchy. However, it offers very little customization, making more it difficult to develop more fleshed out layouts and develop a look and feel.
2. We started to get too consumed in the design and usability of the app during the wireframe development and lost track of the critical foundation our concept was based on.
3. We've been facing the challenge of sustaining our critical framework while designing wireframes and layouts that make sense. We chose to work towards a speculative design model rather than a more usability-focused prototype, because we want to explore the potential social critique and impact of the HyperLit concept. However, in building wireframes and designing layouts, we keep running into the need to develop something that is understandable, intuitive, functional, and user friendly. It's really difficult to do both!
