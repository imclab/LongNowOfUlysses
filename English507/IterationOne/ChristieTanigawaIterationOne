#Documentation: 

## Workflow for Project 1: 
* Locate historical maps of Dublin from Special Collection's archive
* select three historical maps to layer over Google Earth 
* scan the maps in sections using Vue Scan
* stich maps together using Photoshop
* layer the maps in Google Earth (adjust images accordingly) 
* select objects from exhibit acquisition list
** look specifically for objects that can be located in Dublin 
* take photos of exhibit objects
* locate the objects (latitude and longitude) in Dublin 
* create placemarks in Google Earth and link placemarks to images of exhibit objects
* using Google Earth API create a version that can work on an independent site

## Workflow of Project 2: 
* Determine height ratio by dividing the number of words locatable in a place with the total word count of Ulysses (roughly 265,000 words). 
* Stitch scanned images of historical map using Photoshop
* Create plane in Mudbox
* Overlap stitched map using Projection tool
* Use sculpt tool to deform plane (elevations represent larger temporal)
* Export movie of map using Render>Create Turntable Movie
* Export layer as .stl file for printing
* Print tactile map

## Questions: 
* Is there any value to seeing the historical context of Dublin? What changes can you see between the map layers? What changes can you not see or would like to see?
* How can we make this more user friendly and more of something that people get something... anything... out of?
* How do you see yourself interacting with the tactile map?
* Should the finished product be a screencast video of clicking through the maps? 

## Things that have gone wrong, were surprising, etc.: 
* Map Tac was not going to be ideal for the tactile geotemporality project.
* Working with Google Earth was not as difficult as I anticipated. 
* Ulysses is not always an easy text to pin to a geographical location.
* The projects kept evolving. 
* There are a lot of mapping tools out there. 

 

For this iteration, please submit the following: 

* Documentation of some or all of your workflow for the project, using text, images, video, or a combination of media to show others how this becomes that.  
* A draft component of your project, ideally in working or interactive form.  
* A revised needs assessment and outcomes statement. 
* Three specific questions you have for the group. 
* A list of at least three things that have gone wrong, surprised you, or the like.
