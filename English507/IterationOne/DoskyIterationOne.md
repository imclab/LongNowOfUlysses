Workflow: Marking the Minutes & Stimulating the Seconds: Annotating the Hours of *Ulysses*

It was not until I decided on the data model I was going to use that the structure that my workflow would have to adopt revealed itself to me. While adopting Timeline.js's data model has and will continue to set limits on what I can accomplish, particularly in relation to the design aspect of my project, in many ways it has rendered my workflow fairly straightforward. That said, there have been moments when I would have liked to be able to customize the data model or modify the visualization by infusing it with elements that would allow my project to remain true to my original vision. However, as of yet I have not tested the limits of Timeline.js or discovered all of the features that I might customize--right now I am using the default version. At this juncture my understanding is that it is meant to be user-friendly software, and therefore resists a high degree of customization. That said, I maintain that using Timeline.js is the best choice of software for me right now given that my computer knowledge is in the the early stages of development. Its interface, which is easy to navigate, provided me with the opportunity to (more or less) manifest my initial creative idea in a way that is still manageable.

My workflow for creating the timeline can be separated into four general phases that, in a process of accretion, build upon one another in a more or less linear path of development. The four main tasks in my workflow are as follows: 1. Writing Phase, 2. Data Gathering Phase, 3. Data Editing Phase, 4. Publishing Phase. In addition, I would like to note that as it stands right now steps two and three occur concomitantly. Furthermore, it is possible that once the project has been published to the web that step number two will continually be in process while the labour force behind the project will oscillate between phases three and four in order to produce dynamic content. I will proceed by outlining a more detailed workflow for each of the four main steps in the process of development for my project.

The Writing Phase: Devising a Prompt

*  Determine what you want the outcome of the project to be. What kind of information will you need to draw out of respondents in order to realize your end goal? Do you want critical readings of the text? Do you want free associations? Both? (After consulting two professors that had conflicting concerns about the types of responses I would receive, I resolved that I would try to tailor my prompt to garner responses that were critically informed with the expectation that the types of responses I would receive would range from being criticially informed to being blatant free associations. (What I learned: people rarely do what you want them to.)

*  Determine *how* to prompt respondents so as to extract the desired information from them. (My tactics: Use a scholarly tone in order to elicit thoughtful responses. Incorporate an element of gamification that encourages respondents to provide annotations that respond directly to the prompt.

*  Test the prompt. Send out a draft of the prompt to anyone who is willing to read it (with few additional directions) and assess the responses you receive 

*  Reflect on your sample results. Edit the prompt. Test it again. This time debrief the people who tested your prompt. Ask them if they understood what you wanted from them, what your purpose was, how they should have responded in order to fulfill the mandate, etc.

*  Refine the prompt again. Produce a final, polished draft.

Below is a serires of screen grabs that track the evolution of my prompt. The first image presents the first draft of my prompt. The second image depicts a version of the prompt in the process of being edited. The third and fourth images are of the final prompt. The three images together display the evolution on the prompt and also visualize my workflow during the writing phase.

Data Gathering Phase: Working With a Data Model

*  Create a new sheet in Google Drive. 
*  Insert a form. Fill in the necessary information to create the form. I decided to produce questions that would elicit information in a sequence that would correspond to the fields that appear in the data model that Timeline.js provides. This ensured that rendering the data I collected would be as simple as copying the information contained in my sheet and pasting it in the ready-made data model. The images below display the form I created along with its corresponding spreadsheet.

*  After you have created a polished form, you need to solicit participants. In my attempts to garner participants I exploited social media outlets, relevant listservs, and forged relationships with professors from around the world. In short: disseminate your prompt in as many ways as you can--you can never have too many participants. Send them the form.

Data Editing Phase:

*  If you are able, fill in any fields that remain vacant. 
*  Delete frivolous and nonsensical responses as well as those incomplete responses that cannot be amended.
*  Check to make sure that the information in each field is appropriate in relation to the question that was asked. 
*  Copyedit the remaining entries.

The final product should look something like this:

Publishing Phase: Making the Timeline Available to the Public

*  Transfer the responses that you have accumulated from your sheet to the data model for Timeline.js. The data model for Timeline.js should appear in a separate sheet. Make sure that you paste the data into their corresponding fields in the data model or the timeline will not render.

*  Once everything appears to be in order, you may publish the timeline to the web. Select "File," then "Publish to the web..." Next, copy the link that appears in the section "Get a link to the published data" and paste it into the "TimelineJS Embed Generator" that appears on the homepage of of the [Timeline.js](http://timeline.verite.co/) website. An embed code is also provided, which allows you to publish your timeline wherever you want it to appear.

Project Draft:

I have decided to [draft](http://embed.verite.co/timeline/?source=0AsalqSmV3d5sdDBXdDVyUElzNGN0LTl6ODlwVE1jMEE&font=Bevan-PotanoSans&maptype=toner&lang=en&height=650) the responses that I have received for the excerpt from "Circe." This is the first time I have investigated a bank of responses that did not come from students in either 560 or 507. Jentery: you were right. I admit it. There is so much free association going on. What am I going to do? Ah!

I will also include a link to [Alyssa McLeod's timeline](http://web.uvic.ca/~amcleod/timeline/), which I have been referring to as I build my project. I would like to adopt a legend similar to the one that Alyssa uses. Using her method of separating entries on the timeline will (hopefully) allow me to use one tier to display the excerpt. I will use the remaining two tiers to separate annotations that present critical insights and could potentially be useful in scholarship from those that are the product of free association. These types of annotations will be plotted on the third tier. 

Questions:

1. How would you deal with the large number of free associations I have received? I'm not even sure that there are *any* insightful responses for "Circe." 
2. What are some viable options for taking the web-based content and transferring it into a material display that will appear in the library?
3. Is there a way you can envision modifying my project so as to minimize its reliance on human participants? 
4. Producing dynamic content for my timeline is contingent upon the availability of a labour force. Can you imagine a way that my project could remain dynamic, but also be more autonomous so that less labour is required to keep it up in the long run?

Surprises:

1. A lot more responses are the product of free association than I originally expected. Worse--people have linked certain aspects of the excerpt to their personal experiences. 
2.  Timeline.js does not respond well to customization, nor does it have many options for customization.
3. People do not respond. Joyce List, students at other universities, scholars etc.
