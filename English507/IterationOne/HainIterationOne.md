# Bloom Vision: Iteration One

We recently (as in, this past Friday) received the [stereoscope kit](http://www.3dstereo.com/viewmaster/vn-holm.html) in the mail. It's being kept in the Maker Lab for now, where I'll start to photograph and 3D-model it, hopefully this week or early next week. I've also decided to make a short video documenting the entire processes of making the physical (wooden) stereoscope, and its digital 3D-model -- from the box to the exhibit. I've had to postpone assembly for now, because we've decided to model the components individually for greater detail and facility in 3D-printing. I have, however, picked out a ![wood stain](https://photos-1.dropbox.com/t/0/AADK0mwGDLwOSVCPkiGpgxm-D5eCpBkIauXNWkR9RR9wlQ/12/136690042/jpeg/32x32/7/_/1/2/WoodStain.jpg/7ghTELjAyD6IokmblZCdVUj3P91L1fsJQaRg_lygwkM?size=800x600): kind of a nice mid-tone that should accent -- without completely hiding -- the natural grain of the wood.  

I've also begun trying to plan where in the physical space of the exhibit the finished stereoscope should go. Since it doesn't relate specifically to any of the content in the [excerpts](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/tree/master/pageExcerpts), it would likely be better suited for the [center cabinets](http://www.flickr.com/photos/93837414@N08/8529165643/#/photos/93837414@N08/8529165643/lightbox/) than perimeter panels, though it could also hang off the wall where the doors are.  

Lastly, I'm in the process of figuring out what kinds of photographs to use in the stereoscope. I've contacted Chris Petter of Special Collections regarding access to the [Gis√®le Freund collection](http://contentdm.library.uvic.ca/cdm/search/collection/collection10) of photographs of James Joyce in Paris. But if part of my goal in this project is to provide exhibit attendees with a significant approximation of early-twentieth century stereoscopic vision -- to see the world as Bloom (someone whose vision has been shaped, even radically altered, by the photograph, and the stereoscope in particular) might have seen it in 1904 -- then there's something anachronistic and geographically inappropriate about using photographs from Paris in the 1930s, rather than Dublin in the early-1900s. Another possible source for images is [Edward Quinn's James Joyce's Dublin](http://www.flickr.com/photos/93837414@N08/8530278194/in/photostream/#/photos/93837414@N08/8530278194/in/photostream/lightbox/), which has some great photographs of the actual spaces Bloom and Stephen navigate in *Ulysses*; however, these photographs are likewise anachronistic, taken in the 1970s.  

So at this point my biggest questions/ concerns are:  
1. What should I do about content? What kinds of photographs would be most appropriate for the exhibit and most interesting for attendees to see in 3D? How big of an issue is anachronism here? Does it take away from the experiential aspect of the project?  
2. Where should we put the finished stereoscope in the physical space of the exhibit?  
3. Any ideas for the video? How can I make it different from [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQZlnFjBkws&feature=share&list=UUOks0hDQ02OK2yDKj2QOWTw)? (or should I? I actually quite like this video...)

This last one is sort of geared specifically for Jentery, but:  
4. At what point should I stain the wood: before or after modeling the components? Will it make a difference when modeling if the wood is stained or not? Do darker or lighter tones tend to photograph and render in 3D-modeling software better?  

As far as some things that have gone wrong or surprised me so far:   
1. I should have ordered the stereoscope kit a bit earlier. My original goal was to have assembled it by our first draft presentations. On the other hand, now that we've decided to model the components individually, actually assembling the stereoscope is no longer very pressing.   
2. I think I've spent a lot more time thinking about the experiential aspect of the project than about the actual photographic content, which I'm realizing now is definitely a concern. I do, however, plan to have something of a booklet of photo sets to be viewed in the stereoscope, and may consider including images from various sources.   
3. I'm surprised I didn't think of making a video before Jentery parenthetically suggested it in my interim report feedback. I'm actually less interested in stereoscopy in itself than as an important precursor to cinema, and most of the material I've been reading on Joyce and cinema treats Bloom's offhand references to stereoscopy with cinema in mind. And when I was first brainstorming project ideas I had wanted to do something with [Thomas Edison's Sandow the Strong Man footage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQxm_nPIw), which Joyce references in *Ulysses* far more incessantly than stereoscopy. So once I had settled on the stereoscope route, why did I stop thinking about film? Why not make a video?  

Note: this is a tentative commit and will be followed tomorrow morning by some photos of the stereoscope components.
