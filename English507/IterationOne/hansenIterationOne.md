#Hansen Iteration One

##UlyssesAfterlives

###Workflow

Since first conceiving of this project, I have come a long way (I think, at least). At first, I planned on creating a really ambitious Flash animation chronicling every possible iteration of *Ulysses* I could find. Now, after having come to terms with the issue of do-ability, I am chronicling the first translations of *Ulysses*, as well as film and stage adaptations, and other interesting bits I find -- like [ULYSSES SEEN](http://ulyssesseen.com/).  

My main challenge at first was figuring out how to use Google Earth. Google keeps Google Earth separate from Spreadsheet Mapper 3.0 to a certain extent, which forced me to figure out how to change the html in Spreadsheet Mapper if I wanted to use Google Earth.

Initially, I thought I would work with Google Maps because of my difficulty. I have since figured out the basic code for the descriptive bubbles in Google Earth, and now have options.

I have gathered quite a bit of information from analogue and digital sources, and am now in the process of populating my spreadsheet. Once I have completed that task, I will return to formatting my spreadsheet -- content first, aesthetics later.

For now, I am content with the of my info bubbles. I will need to figure out how to insert images into the bubbles -- Google Earth does not seem to recognise URLs to image files on my Google Drive. Figuring this out is my next major task.

###Something to Consider

In my interim report, JS raised some questions that are apparently commonly associated with geospatial interpretations -- namely, is this simply a re-presentation of old info? This is something that I am keeping in the back of my mind as I decide on a narrative tack for my project. At worst, I think there is value in seeing the concentration of *Ulysses* material in Europe, which leads me to question the international relevance of *Ulysses*. Is our "long now" actually a "long and narrow now"?


###Draft Component

[My draft project](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ap8FIppSqxLDdFJZakxSM3ROZzMxU25FNjZuelktU1E&usp=sharing) -- to be opened in [Google Earth](http://www.google.com/earth/index.html).


###Three Questions

1. What do you think of the project in Google Earth v. Google Maps?

2. Should I attempt to make an animation, or should users interact with map by navigating through the bubbles?

3. How much information should I include in each bubble? Keep it short, or give a comprehensive context (if possible)?


###My Challenges/Surprises

1. My hardworking, but exhausted laptop. My workflow is delayed because of the time it takes for my computer to process changes, etc. Also, I have avoided copying and pasting my logs into GitHub because it is a bit of a hassle (sometimes I have to commit three times before GitHub actually saves my work). 

2. My lack of knowledge of Spreadsheet Mapper 3.0 and general inability to work with charts and spreadsheets. 

3. Unanticipated: how much I am enjoying populating my spreadsheet and checking my changes in Google Earth now that my draft is taking shape.
