# HyperLit - Workflow Documentation

## Stage 1: Concepting
We began by working through tons and tons of different concepts, ideas, tools, and lots of useless stuff. Some of these included:

* Visualization of the overlap between Odyssey, Ulysses, and Now in a timeline format that includes images, visual, audio, and animation.
* Narrativize your day using a GPS tracker to tag the user's activities on campus based on location that then gets "narrativized" in text form that is overlaid on a campus map (the words appear on the map). The user can edit and add to the textual narrative to embellish his/her day.
* Gamified calendar that gives points and badges for different types of daily activities, which are represented as a web comic or animation. Going to the exhibit gets to the most points, and if you reach a certain number of points you get "special secret access" to a locked component at the exhibit.
* Geo-caching game that allows players to find Ulysses-related artifacts across campus and locations in Victoria.

## Stage 2: Idea Refinement
Focusing on the gamification-related ideas, we refined our concept. Taking inspiration from Katherine Hayles' ["Hyper and Deep Attention"](http://www.mlajournals.org.ezproxy.library.uvic.ca/doi/abs/10.1632/prof.2007.2007.1.187), Jonathan Beller's ["Paying Attention"](http://cabinetmagazine.org/issues/24/beller.php) and [*The Cinematic Mode of Production*](http://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Cinematic_Mode_of_Production.html?id=Kpvk-q33mrUC), and Hannah Arendt's ["Society and Culture"](http://www.jstor.org/stable/20026571?origin=JSTOR-pdf), we began to consider ways to use a calendar integration to visualize the user's daily cycle of labour and leisure while tying such habits in with the reading of classical literature, which not only allows us to focus on *Ulysses* for the purpose of the exhibit, but also brings in the challenges of Hayles' hyper and deep attention modes and Arendt's distinction between cultural objects and consumer entertainment goods. Our concept took shape in the form of a gamified social reading environment that aims to create awareness of the labour-productive cycle of habits we live and the forms of entertainment we engage with, offer an environment in the realm of hyper attention (a digital game app) that enables deep attention (by incorporating possibilities of focused hyper attention in the reading platform), encourage the reading of classical literature through social, points- and level-based gamification, and make critical, interpretive reading accessible to all types of readers (through links, scholarly annototations, and social annotations and discussion forums).

## Stage 3: Feasibility and Methodology
In addition to narrowing our ideas to a gamified reading app with a calendar plug-in, we also began looking at technical feasibility and realized that in order to actually develop such an app, we'd need to build a Google Calendar plugin using JavaScript, integrate the calendar through an API and visualize it using PHP, and then build an interactive website that plugs into social media networks.

Rather than building a full app, we decided to develop a model. Looking at types of models, we opted to plan a speculative design model. As Jonathan Lukens explains in ["Speculative Design and Technological Fluency"](http://ijlm.net/fandf/10.1162/IJLM_a_00080), this approach allows us to focus on a critical approach and consider the social effects our gamified reading app might have, rather than building a prototype from a consumer or usability perspective.

## Stage 4: Wireframing
We began by creating hand-drawn wireframe sketches to come up with the key frames required to communicate our app concept.

Next, we went through several iterations of wireframes using [Balsamiq](http://www.balsamiq.com/).

ROUND 1:

## Stage 5: Look & Feel
We are now in the process of developing a look and feel for the app, creating visual assets, and preparing an animated storyboard for the *Games Without Frontiers* event on March 9th, 2013.


## 3 Things that Went Wrong, Surprised Us, etc.

1. We were surprised by the limitations of Blasamiq. It seems to be a really useful and intuitive tool for the initial sketching of wireframes, making it easy to work through and play around with content buckets and information hierarchy. However, it offers very little customization, which makes it difficult to develop more fleshed out layouts and develop a look and feel.
2. We started to get too consumed in the design and usability of the app during the wireframe development and lost track of the critical foundation our concept was based on.
3. We've been facing the challenge of sustaining our critical framework while designing wireframes and layouts that make sense. We chose to work towards a speculative design model rather than a more usability-focused prototype, because we want to explore the potential social critique and impact of the HyperLit concept. However, in building wireframes and designing layouts, we keep running into the need to develop something that is understandable, intuitive, functional, and user friendly. It's really difficult to do both!

## Zaqir's Responses:
Does the order of frames that we're presenting the app functionality in make sense to you? 

* Yes, very coherent, no overt flaws in the structure of the app.

Can you list the activities and functionalities offered in HyperLit?

* Mapping your time to know when you can and cannot read
* Will be reading in increments determined by you or the app depending on challenges, but no matter what way you read will be recorded and activities during reading (like commenting, user input) is recorded
* Text is marked up for interactivity
* There's a community challenging and interacting each o ther, challenges, leaderboards, statistics
* Web comic looks like it's just different user profiles (make this page clearer by including a bigger title, explanation, etc)

Is the critical framework we described today inherent in the demo of the app, or does it seem like just another app commodifying an activity?

* Seems to be merging textual work with pop culture life - making people close readers whether they know it or not
* Uses non-traditional approaches that will seem normal to common web user

Consider pointing to different apps like it to explain what our app would do?

## Shaun's Responses:
Does the order of frames that we're presenting the app functionality in make sense to you?

* Move News feed to follow sign in page (user front page)
* Include an alert screen — time to read!

Can you list the activities and functionalities offered in HyperLit?

* Sign, in—access calendar
* See news feed/site features/scoreboard
* Promtpt for reading
* Summary of reading/annotations/achievements

Is the critical framework we described today inherent in the demo of the app, or does it seem like just another app commodifying an activity?

* It is coherent — I would add a "distraction" level in the app (that could be downloaded on mobile devices too) and different degrees of annotations that could contribute to pop-up explanatory links in the text (moderated, of course)
* I don't think it merely commodifies, if the end result is analysis
*  sStats at the end of the book tracking changes in reading habits, levels of annotation, and degree of critical analysis
* Points based on quality of critique


General comments:

* Making the reading experience a social experience
* Open-source app - like a MOOD environment!!! change the game, add material, etc.
