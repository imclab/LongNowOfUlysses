##First Iteration.
Working with some of Joyce's biographies, I have now assembled some data in my Google Spreadsheet to populate the three areas on the map that I wanted to focus on: Trieste, Zürich, Paris.

Spreadsheet Mapper 3.1 automatically updates and transfers this information in Google Maps. The following preliminary [sample map](https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub%3Fkey%3DtGDp-MmftpuR08QRbgqtubA%26single%3Dtrue%26gid%3D0%26output%3Dtxt%26time1%3D4133838), warts and all, should provide an idea of what I'm trying to achieve here. The texts describing the individual contributors (both "direct" and "indirect" influences on Joyce's novel) are complete for the most part; pictures, portraits, and (most importantly) images of the actual correspondence, however, are still missing.

Three surprising things I realized along the way:

* it is incredibly hard to assign each of the correspondents or contributors I identified a placemark, which is required, by definition, in a project that attempts to *map* these connections. Often I had to dig quite deeply to find *any* location associated with a person, let alone the actual address where that person lived at the time he or she had an effect on Joyce's process of composing *Ulysses*. 
* it has become apparent that the initial decision to model *three* zones of the network (Trieste, Zürich, Paris) is problematic, because there is quite some overlap in these networks, some important contributors in Dublin are not contained by my approach, and contributors have moved over time, even in the years 1914-1922. 
* it was surprising to realize that the majority of the correspondence between Joyce and his contributors only includes Joyce's requests. The occasional *answer* that survived is a rare find. This has forced me to rethink my idea of letting Joyce's contributors speak for themselves. It is a sad fact that, in most cases, these original utterances have been lost—either because Joyce did not keep them, or because subsequent Joyce scholarship focused so much on the genius author that it neglected to preserve the contributions that made the genius possible.       

##Questions for the group

* Do you think that the network needs to be conveyed visually, e.g. through a graphic overlay that connects the nodes? If so, how would you recommend doing this? And how do I avoid making the representation seem to be disjointed, with the different contributors being placed so far away from each other—in particular in the aerial view of Europe that the map now starts with?
* Do you have an idea how I can solve the problem that the data I assembled seems to fit my three-network approach poorly? Would it be too much, for example, to include a fourth layer with the "Dubliners"? And given the fact that the infrastructure of Google's Spreadsheet Mapper does not allow me to assign the same placemark to two different networks/layers, do you have an idea how to represent, e.g., Joyce's "constant contributors"?  
* What do you think would be the best way of displaying/mounting these maps in the exhibit space? (I'm thinking of print-outs of the networks, but this seems to me quite dissatisfying, because I think the "cool" thing about this project is its interactiveness, i.e. the fact that a viewer can *explore* the map and the locations/people in digital depth, rather than just looking at a flat paper.)
