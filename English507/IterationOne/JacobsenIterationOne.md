# Iteration One

First iteration of my remediation of *Ulysses*. I purchased a Penguin edition printed in 1979 that I found in a used book store (see image: ["Penguin Edition Ulysses"](http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/607/penguineditionulysses.jpg/)). I chose this edition simply because I thought it was the coolest looking copy on the shelf. Because the browser I generally use was chosen rather haphazardly, I felt that a similar choice of 'interface', based on aesthetics rather than on any sort of evaluated merit, was justified.

Initially, I had thought that I would begin my remediation at the hour of the day in the narrative that corresponds with the hour in the day that I began web browsing: four o'clock pm. "Sirens," the chapter of *Ulysses* that marks the sixteenth hour of the day, falls on page 254 in the Penguin edition. I quickly changed my mind: firstly, I realized that one begins a book at the beginning, and, in mapping my reading of digital content onto a print novel, I want to replicate the way one actually reads novels; and, secondly, I have no idea whether or not my twenty-four hour history of web browsing will even reach the end of the novel, or "Sirens," for that matter, and if the reading I am performing is not made obvious at the outset, it might confuse its audience.

The second dilemma that I encountered was deciding whether or not a bounce to a new domain, rather than a page change within the same domain, was a meaningful distinction. Initially, I felt it was. But, the more I thought about it, the less convinced I became on this point. To me, it seems that linking to a new page, whether or not the user remains at the same domain, might actually not be as important a distinction as I had first thought. In addition, I was unable to determine how I would represent this distinction within my remediation. I decided that I would not be able to make an honest differentiation between bounce types: for example, if I link to a new domain but am still researching the same topic, there remains a continuity of subject; whereas, if I open a new tab and check my email, check my bank balance, check Facebook, or do some totally unrelated task, these domain changes are not equivalent in terms of continuity. Because it seems that a distinction based solely on domain change, without considering every actual articulation of domain and nature of change (probably impossible at this point and highly subjective), I believe that levelling the distinction and treating all bounces as equal is a more equitable choice.

So, with that decided, I printed out my data (a transcription of time elapsed per page, bounces, and domains compiled from a single twenty-four hour period of my own Google Chrome history); I found an online timer, with an alarm; I set it for the intervals that I needed; and then, arranging the screen so that I would not be distracted by the timer, I opened up *Ulysses* and began to read:

> "STATELY, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. A yellow dressing-gown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him by the mild morning air. He held the bowl aloft and intoned:
> > - *Introibo ad altare Dei.*

> Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called up coarsely:
>> Come up,..."

*BRRRIIIINNNGGGGG*

Alarm! Twenty seconds elapsed. I take a razor blade and a cutting matt, and I cut out the last word I read, "Kinch," Mulligan's nickname for Stephen Dedalus. Underneath, the cut-out text reveals the word "and." (see image: ["Cut 1"](http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/191/cut1z.jpg/)). I thought, "brilliant," I will simply strike through all of the text until I reach the "and" on the underlying page, thus "replicating" the link through to a new page (layered underneath the previous page), and also rendering all of the text I will bounce over, as I "link" to the new page. 

I repeated the process with a few more timed readings and cuts. The results provided some interesting continuity. Here are the examples, where [] = the word revealed on the underlying page, and the text that follows is read on the new page, with the timer reset:

> "Come up, [and] look.
> Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet."

> "The aunt thinks you killed your [beg] from these swine. I'm the only one that knows what you are." (see image: "Cut 2)

> "Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe's [boomed] out the stairhead"


I was excited by the process, and I thought how interesting it might be to have others, who are familiar with the novel, read the remediated text and interpret this complex novel, cut-up and reorganized. 


But then...trouble! I read to the end of one page, flipped to the verso, alarm, cut...turn back to the page I just came from? Oh, no! I was now reading the novel backwards. I had not yet done any of the strikethrough, so I thought, this might be salvageable, maybe even desirable. I realized that, of course, I do not read the web in a linear fashion, and I often return, again and again, to the home page of a site, to my email inbox, to a page I've been before. So, of course my reading of the novel based on how I read the web would not follow a linear pattern. Great! An unexpected surprise. So, I went with it, roaming back over the pages I had just read. But, the further back I went, the more the cuts on the verso affected the recto, and, when I looked at it holistically, it made no sense at all to someone who would read it in a linear fashion. Also, the position of the typeface on the verso does not correspond to that of the recto, so the surprising and compelling narrative that was revealed in the initial cuts did not surface, and really just seemed to make a mess of things. (See image: ["verso cuts"](http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/29/versocuts.jpg/) and ["verso"](http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/29/versocuts.jpg/)

So, I am stuck here, for the moment. I need help! Insight from other thinkers and readers. My questions for the workshop are:

1. How can I maintain the linear structure of reading print novels while at the same time mapping digital reading onto that process? Would it be fair to simply skip the verso text? Even though that is something readers simply do not do?

2. What other ways could a "link" operate in a print text? Does it have to link to the underlying page? Could it connect with the next iteration of the word? Of the grammatical category? 

3. Does this project make sense? Does it make an argument? Is it legible?
