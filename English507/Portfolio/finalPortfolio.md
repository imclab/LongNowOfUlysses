# Final Portfolio  

Congrats! It's time to start thinking about the semester's end, when you will submit a portfolio documenting your project and its relation to the "Long Now of *Ulysses*" exhibit.  

## What Your Portfolio Should Do 

Your final portfolio should:

* Give people who are unfamiliar with your project (its methods and contexts included) a concrete sense of how it developed over time, with particular attention to crucial decisions, surprises, and changes.  
* Provide your audience with a scholarly context for your project, its design, and its argument.  
* Describe your project in brief (so that it can be easily referenced). 
* Demonstrate an awareness of how to combine knowing and doing (or theory and technologies) in digital literary studies. 
* Document your project's history and explain how it could be developed in the future.  
* Articulate how your project relates and contributes to the "Long Now of *Ulysses*" exhibit. 
* Provide audiences with your data, data model, and bibliography.  

## What to Include 

Your final portfolio should include (at least) the following: 

* Screengrabs and other documentation of your project (e.g., drawn from your logs this semester) and, by extension, your contributions to the "Long Now of *Ulysses* Exhibit" (consider captions or descriptions for materials, where necessary) 
* Your project's title
* A tagline (no more than twelve words) for your project (not a complete sentence) 
* A URL to view or download your project (unless the project is included in the portfolio itself) 
* A 50- to 75-word abstract for your project
* A 1000- to 2000-word narrative explaining and justifying your project and its contributions to the exhibit (including its relevance to or role in the exhibit) 
* A 500- to 1000-word reflection statement on which aspects of your project's development met your expectations and which aspects surprised you
* A 250- to 500-word statement for future development, including what aspects of your project you (or others) could and should develop in the future (assuming more time, support, and materials) 
* Your data and data model 
* A bibliography for your project

All writing should be well polished, concise, anchored in evidence, and intended for an informed, non-expert audience (e.g., people who may not know much about *Ulysses* or digital literary studies).  

## Format 

The final project can be submitted in whatever format you prefer: DOCX, PDF, Markdown, HTML, a website, or transmedia (e.g., a combination of video and text). Use of video or audio should be accompanied by a transcript. 

At some point in March, I recommend consulting with me about your approach. Where necessary, I am happy to provide you with resources and to even offer tutorials / workshops when student interest in a particular approach/topic is significant.

## Due Date (April 16th) 

Please submit your portfolio by 11:59pm on Thursday, April 16th. At a minimum, to our GitHub repo, you should push a file pointing to your portfolio (e.g., a URL where I can view it or download it). Of course, you are also welcome to push the entire portfolio (or a backup of it) to our repo. 

Please push all portfolio-related materials to the "Portfolio" subdirectory in "English507". 

## Presentation (April 2nd)

To help you prepare your final portfolio, during our final seminar (on Tuesday, April 2nd), you will present your project via a roundtable consisting of three or four people, for twenty or twenty-five minutes, respectively. (I will assign you to a group.) 

People from outside the seminar will be invited. Each roundtable will be followed by a ten-minute question-and-answer period.  

Each roundtable should be "collaborative" in its design and implementation. How you present (including content, style, and technologies used) is up to you. However, please keep in mind two things: 

* You should reflect on and assess what you learned during the entire seminar (meaning it is not solely about your project's content), and 

* Everyone participating in your roundtable will be given the same grade (meaning collaboration is key). 

Please do not use the roundtable as an opportunity to only read text from your final project.
