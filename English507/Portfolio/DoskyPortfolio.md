## Crowdsourced Readings of James Joyce’s *Ulysses*

# Abstract

As an extension of “The Long Now of *Ulysses*” gallery exhibit opening at the University of Victoria on May 17th, 2013, my project presents crowdsourced close readings of a handful of algorithmically selected excerpts from Ulysses. It expands the intertextual possibilities of *Ulysses* and arrives at ways of contextualizing the novel that both supplement the original historical context of the novel and depart from it. Contributors were invited to draw connections between the excerpts and the contemporary everyday via the media of their choice to inspire and accent their commentary. The collected responses for a single excerpt were displayed on a timeline; the timeline illustrates the range of connections that readers made based on their brief interaction with *Ulysses*.

# The Early Stages

There is a sizeable community, comprised of scholars and amateurs alike, that is dedicated to studying [James Joyce](http://www.themodernword.com/joyce/joyce_links.html) and his works, including *Ulysses*. No matter how much work has been done on the novel though, there are passages that continue to confound scholars, allusions that remain untapped, and nuances that wind up lost amid the thousands of pages of Joyce’s dense prose. 

At the outset, the primary goals I had for my project were ambitious; I hoped, at the very least, to narrow some of the lacunae that may have hampered *Ulysses* scholarship up until this point. My initial idea, which I carried through to completion (though my project goals have changed considerably) was to invite a range of people to perform close readings of the twenty-two-line long excerpts of *Ulysses* that will appear in the University of Victoria’s [Maltwood Gallery]( http://uvac.uvic.ca/Locations/Mcpherson.html) exhibit beginning in May 2013. 

As I worked with my original project idea, my line of thinking was akin to Samuels and McGann’s tract in their article, “[Deformance and Interpretaion]( http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&type=summary&url=/journals/new_literary_history/v030/30.1mcgann.html).” Samuels and McGann view each and every iteration of a text, whether it be an edition or a malformation, as a separate performance of a text from which unique and valuable critical insights may arise; furthermore, they propose that scholars engage with deformed texts more regularly; they suggest, “deformance does not banish interpretation,” and that working with deformed texts may confound the reader into unearthing new critical insights. 

At the beginning of the term, I approached my project with the notion that I would leverage a diverse crowd comprised of academics and non-academics alike and would garner original and insightful readings of the selected excerpts of *Ulysses*. My thinking was that the algorithmically selected excerpts of *Ulysses* would serve as disorienting performances of the text that would, in keeping with the modernist mantra, make *Ulysses* new again. Allied with Ang and Pothen in their article, "[Between Promise and Practice: Web 2.0, Intercultural Dialogue and Digital Scholarship](http://fourteen.fibreculturejournal.org/fcj-094-between-promise-and-practice-web-2-0-intercultural-dialogue-and-digital-scholarship/)," I wanted to develop a "participatory mode of cultural production," and likewise "did not start out with a preconceived idea, or even consensus, of what the outcome [of the project] might be," except that I wanted the project to be a worthwhile contribution to *Ulysses* scholarship. 

# Project Overview
 
My project invites users to contribute to a community reading of *Ulysses*. It delivers publically accessible readings of a number of the algorithmically selected excerpts from *Ulysses*. By annotating excerpts of *Ulysses*, my project situates Joyce’s modernist icon at the center of our own contemporary web of allusive media, and points to some of the ways in which the past continues to figure in contemporary life, as well as the extent to which we read the past in terms of contemporary life.  My project:

*  Links *Ulysses* to contemporary everyday

*  Expands and reimagines the intertextual possibilities of the novel

*  Exposes increasing literary relevance of the multimodal technologies that are a salient part of our everyday lives.

*  Provides contextual information about the text (and more specifically the passage) in terms of historical events, specific cultural milieus or biographical context 

*  Tracks the vibrant and multifarious afterlives of *Ulysses*

To render the results of my collective, web-based annotation project I have decided to use the open-source visualization software, [Timeline.js](http://timeline.verite.co/), which allows users to plot events in time, accenting commentary with multiple media found on the Internet. Timeline.js is very user-friendly; it provides a basic data model [template]( https://drive.google.com/previewtemplate?id=0AppSVxABhnltdEhzQjQ4MlpOaldjTmZLclQxQWFTOUE&mode=public), and while the creators of Timeline.js allow experts to customize the software, they do not demand that the user have a working knowledge of JSON (the scripting language in which it is written). They offer a number of options for customization that satisfy basic user wants and needs. That said, being unfamiliar with JSON limits the degree to which Timeline.js can be customized. 

# The Process

I began my effort gathering annotations by drafting a [prompt](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fNqYu_5fIXrcGCFxRCQ3Jr1UGVLBQWPz-JxtHD3kgxI/viewform) that I would later disseminate to potential contributors. The prompt outlined my goals for the project, situated it in terms of the larger public exhibit, and encouraged users to share their best ideas because some of the most interesting and insightful contributions would appear in the gallery exhibit. 

In an attempt to bring my original project goals to fruition, and after considering words of caution from my instructors about the types of responses I might receive if I were to make the form open-access, the majority of my attempts at soliciting respondents were directed towards communities of students, academics, and the like. I sent my prompt out through the [Modernist Studies Association](http://msa.press.jhu.edu/) listserv, the "[*Ulysses* Reading List](http://groups.yahoo.com/subscribe/Joyce-Ulysses)", [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), the SubReddit entitled [R/Literature](http://www.reddit.com/r/literature), instructors at the [University of Ottawa](http://www.sylviehill.com/), [Queen Mary University of London](http://www.english.qmul.ac.uk/staff/pricek.html), and the [University of Western Ontario](http://www.uwo.ca/english/faculty/groden.html), and finally through a series of personal emails to friends and family. My form was configured in such a way that the responses were siphoned into the relevant fields of the data model that Timeline.js provided, which resided in a Google Spreadsheet; I did work copyediting and tagging responses in the spreadsheet before I published the timelines to the web. You can find the data model for ‘Circe’ [here]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsalqSmV3d5sdDBXdDVyUElzNGN0LTl6ODlwVE1jMEE#gid=0) and the data model for ‘Telemachus’ [here]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsalqSmV3d5sdDVTLXBHTG50NWwzT0hJMTZWSnllT2c#gid=0) 

As I began to accumulate responses to the excerpts, I found that they did not offer the types of readings of *Ulysses* that I imagined they would. Instead of offering insights into some of the plausible historical contexts of the novel, I was surprised to find that for the most part the readings were comprised of free associations with contemporary culture or even respondents' personal lives. This was especially surprising to me because I was fairly selective when it came time to choose the crowd I was working with.

 Furthermore, I found that those who contributed annotations to my project grounded their annotations in a small selection of words or phrases from the excerpts. However, as my prompt invited respondents to explore the "[Long Now](http://longnow.org/)" of *Ulysses* it was not uncommon for contemporary associations to obfuscate the more probable historical allusions in the novel. What was most interesting to me about this, is that the original historical context of the excerpt became masked, and the meaning of something like “London’s Burning,” which was originally a [nursery rhyme,]( http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/place-nireland/A288966) was supplanted by the Clash’s song “[London’s Burning]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCw9_avTlYs)” or the [bombings]( http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/july7) that occurred in 2005 in London.

Timeline.js has built in support for Twitter, Flickr, Google Maps, YouTube, Vimeo, DailyMotion, Wikipedia, and SoundCloud, and allows contributors to add commentary to supplement their media selection. After I received a collection of responses, I settled on plotting the annotations I received from contributors on a series of timelines (one for each excerpt) in such a way that would display the crowd's tendencies as it reads *Ulysses* and--as I learned after collecting my data--its overwhelming engagement with contemporary allusions. I also tagged the turn of phase that the contributors latched on to in the passage I provided, and then I plotted the different media on the timelines, situating them in terms of when the referenced event/object/etc. occurred in history. Finally, my project will convert select multimedia annotations into rotating content for the gallery exhibit that will open in June at the University of Victoria's Maltwood Gallery. 

In “[Humanistic Theory and Digital Scholarship](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/34)” Johanna Drucker challenges humanists to find ways of rendering humanities data digitally that shapes the digital environment instead of being amenable to it. Drucker asks whether we can “create graphical interfaces and digital platforms from humanistic methods.” In terms of humanities scholarship, she emphasizes the importance of “showing interpretation, modeling it, making a composition space in which ambiguity and contradiction can coexist, where the non-self-identicality of objects can be made as evident as their codependent relation to the social fields of production from which they spring.” My project is persuasive in that it does not sacrifice the humanistic method by attempting to reify *Ulysses*; it does not present “predictable outcomes and repeatable results.” On the contrary, my effort to garner a range of responses to the excerpts, and my refusal to keep only responses that helped to fulfill my initial goals for the project, resists making a totalizing statement about the novel. Though the reader responses I received were plotted on timelines (one of Drucker’s examples of a visualization technique borrowed from domains that are fraught with empirical modes of study), my timelines highlight the constructed nature of meaning making by visualizing content as opposed to statistics, and retaining annotations that are redundant, in addition to those that are not as critically informed as one might hope them to be; by embracing the anomalous responses I received, my project expands the imaginative space of the text. The only thing my timeline reifies is that, as Drucker advocates, all information is in fact capta, “that which is taken as interpretation rather than data, [which] comes sharply into relief.”

 In “[Where’s the Beef? Does Digital Humanities Have to Answer Questions?]( http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/18),” Tom Scheinfeldt suggests (perhaps controversially) that it may appear as though digital humanities is not answering enough questions or making strong enough arguments to justify the large grants researchers in the field receive for their projects. However, by comparing the tools used in the digital humanities to many scientific tools, which Scheinfeldt points out, took years to realize their full potential, Scheinfeldt suggests that it is important to allow for a period of experimentation before expecting that the digital humanities makes strong arguments and answers pointed questions. Although my project was not entirely successful in fulfilling its initial academic initiative, it is only through the experimentation and supposed ‘failure’ of projects that we can move towards mastering the use of tools and creating humanities-specific tools that remain grounded in the humanistic method and reach a point where, eventually, we can consistently make compelling arguments and answer dense questions. 

#An Extended Foray into Crowdsourcing—Wait—What is Crowdsourcing Anyways?

Inevitably, the project I devised demanded that I garner contributors who would supply meaningful annotations on the selected excerpts from *Ulysses*. I let on earlier that my project did not give rise to the results I hoped it would in terms of the content I received. However, like Ang and Pothen, the 'failure' of my project "emphasize[d] the need for intellectual leadership and pro-active vision to create new knowledge and socially and politically useful forms of intercultural dialogue" ([Ang](http://fourteen.fibreculturejournal.org/fcj-094-between-promise-and-practice-web-2-0-intercultural-dialogue-and-digital-scholarship/)). Without such leadership, crowdsourced projects, like my own, may stagnate and become representations of how the crowd engages with online material as opposed to modes of rigorous dialogue. The ‘failure’ of my project raised a lot of questions about crowdsourcing; eventually crowdsourching became the central focus of my project. This was especially apt because I found that I directed the majority of my focus towards devising strategies for garnering participants.

While crowdsourcing is not a [new](http://memeburn.com/2011/09/9-examples-of-crowdsourcing-before-%E2%80%98crowdsourcing%E2%80%99-existed/) term or strictly digital practice, the term “crowdsourcing” was coined in 2006 by [Jeff Howe](http://crowdsourcing.typepad.com/about.html), a contributing editor at Wired Magazine in an article entitled [The Rise of Crowdsourcing](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=1&topic=crowds&topic_set=) on [wired.com](http://www.wired.com/) . Howe defined crowdsourcing as a correlative of outsourcing. Like outsourcing, which garners products services from an outside supplier at a reduced rate, crowdsourcing turns towards the amateur, yet informed public to provide information and solutions to problems for little to no cost. 

My project engages in a type of crowdsourcing that is commonly referred to as seeking out 'crowdwisdom.' It adopts a method in which a question is posed to a vast audience that is willing to respond and contribute their expertise in an effort to create new knowledge. Websites like [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/) and [Yahoo Answers](http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/) operate within a framework that relies on crowdwisdom. Furthermore, companies like [InnoCentive](http://www.innocentive.com/) turn to the crowd to come up with solutions for problems that have long stumped professionals in the corporate world. 

More recently, governments have engaged in experimental applications of crowdsourcing. The Nigerian presidential candidate, Goodluck Jonathan, [announced his candidacy on Facebook](http://memeburn.com/2011/06/social-media-govt-iceland-nigeria-rwanda-south-africa/), and grounded his entire campaign effort in social media. In Iceland, crowdsourcing has been used to don the country's citizens with a sense of agency in terms of the [new constitution]( http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-10/23/iceland-crowdsourced-constitution) it has recently drafted. Additionally, in 2010 England's [coalition programme](http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_187876.pdf) asked citizens for their input; however, after receiving 9,500 responses from concerned citizens (not a very large number considering the population that was invited to participate), the result was that [no department](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/aug/02/coalition-crowdsourcing-results-unheeded-whitehall) heeded any of the crowd’s suggestions, in spite of Prime Minister David Cameron's insistence that the project would "offer the potential to completely recast the relationship between people and the state: citizens empowered; individual opportunity extended; communities coming together to make lives better." (Coalition programme 8). 

However, even lower stakes projects, like MTV’s crowdsourced television show *Web Junk 20*, reveal that while crowdsourcing may give rise to large quantities of responses, the quality of them does not often abide by a high standard. Like many other directors of crowdsourced projects, the producers of *Web Junk 20* concede that of the 12,000 videos they received as potential content for their program, "'almost all of them were complete crap'" ([Howe](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=2&topic=crowds&topic_set=) 2). This begs the question: Should an influx of unfavourable responses be accorded to a flippant crowd, or to a haphazard project developer?   

# Crowdsourcing in Academia

In academia crowdsourcing is becoming increasingly prevalent as a mode of solving problems, gaining a range of critical insights, and managing academic workflows. In 2011 a website called [Crowd4U](http://crowd4u.org/) was launched in a number of Japanese universities. Crowd4U limits its crowdsourcing effort to academic projects; it allows academics to make a number of microtasks available for the public to complete.

However, crowdsourcing in academia is fraught with similar issues of quality vs. quantity. "[Beyond Metrics: Community Authorization and Open Peer Review](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/7)," Kathleen Fitzpatick addresses some of the potential problems associated with crowdsourcing peer review in academia, namely the lack of peer review for digital projects. Fitzpatrick discusses solutions for soliciting valuable results from a crowd in relation to academic projects. She talks about approaching her digital project development as a scholar on one hand, and as a blogger on the other; she says, “I was of two distinct minds […] the blogger in me wanted to wave that question off.” Furthermore, Fitzpatrick points to Katherine Rowe’s notion of “our-crowd sourcing,” or being selective when choosing a crowd, as a means of more productively tapping into outside knowledge, and avoiding accumulating a horde of uninformed responses. Fitzpatrick’s reflection that she herself “was of two distinct minds” presents an additional problem for crowdsourced projects: How does on tap into one's crowd’s academic persona as opposed to its online one? Even if one has been selective in choosing one's crowd, one may not receive the types of responses one wants; this is something that I quickly learned as I gathered responses for my project. 

# My Crowdsourcing Effort: Surprises and Things I Have Learned

As I mentioned earlier, I was forewarned about many of the issues that I might be confronted with in choosing to work with a crowd. However, I was surprised, especially after being fairly selective in the crowd that I chose (comprised of academics, students, and the like), to find that the responses I received were free associations for the most part. I would like to return to Fitzpatrick’s reflection that she was of “two distinct minds,” having certain proclivities as a scholar and others as a blogger.  I recognize, in retrospect, that even if you are addressing an academic crowd, it is possible that not all members of the crowd will have their “academic hat” on. Furthermore, skepticism about the legitimacy of all things digital comes into play here as well; it’s a valid participant concern to wonder whether what one are spending one’s time on is going to be a valuable contribution to scholarship. 

Additionally, I found that the potential of my project was hampered in many ways by my inability to customize Timeline.js in ways that would best suit my project; having a knowledge of the programming language JSON would have allowed me to adapt the ready-made tool I decided to use to suit the needs of my particular humanities project. My limited knowledge of JSON, and by extension the tool I decided to use, would be the equivalent of having writing a paper without having performed the requisite amount of research. Given the timeframe of the course, it was not possible to accrue enough of a knowledge of JSON that I would have been able to make systemic changes to Timeline.js. In the event that I take on digital humanities projects in the future, I would be sure to develop an expertise of the script language I would be using before becoming immersed in my project, or to team up with an expert.

After presenting my project at the end-of-term roundtable in our English 507 class, I was surprised to have received some flack from my classmates for not duly considering the free-associative responses that I received. I was confounded, in particular, because my colleagues, like myself, place a high value on rigorous intellectual pursuits. That said, as a look back on our discussion I do not believe my peers’ comments were unwarranted: they pointed out to me the hypocrisy of encouraging a range of responses, and yet diminishing the value many of the free-associative responses that I did receive in such a way that suggested they were invalid. While I viewed my project as a valuable study in crowdsourcing, especially in its enactment of a sort of scientific method—it began with a hypothesis, proceeded in a process of experimentation, resisted retrofitting data and arriving at tidy conclusions in favour of knowledge gained through trial and error—I maintained that the content that was provided by the respondents was less interesting than the range of the actual responses. 

By my thinking, the content was less worthy of attention because, in many ways, it resembled the vacuous comment threads that you so often find as addenda to news articles or YouTube videos. However, now I recognize that there are two major issues that that may arise as a result of my flippant treatment of the content I received. The first is an issue surrounding the crowd’s willingness to contribute to crowdsourced academic projects in the future. In response to the UK government's failure to consider its citizens' input (which it zealously encouraged), Simon Burall, the director of Involve, a national advisory Group, said: "'You have to give the government some credit for trying to do this, but badly designed consultations like this are worse than no consultations at all. They diminish trust and reduce the prospect that people will engage again'" ([Wintour](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/aug/02/coalition-crowdsourcing-results-unheeded-whitehall)1). While the consequences of eschewing participant responses for the government may give rise to far more weighty problems in the future than they would for academics, it is especially important to consider the fate of future academic projects and to ensure that academics have the necessary crowd support should they choose to pursue crowdsourced initiatives. Digital crowdsourced projects require people to take initiative, and engage of their own volition. Participation may be issued as a large-scale invitation, and is not personally mandated in the way that a traditional article peer review might be--this means participating is cutting into participants’ free time and they do not receive any credit for their contributions. At the very least, it is important to ensure that responses are being used—community building is an essential part of any crowdsourcing effort.

Secondly, after reading a [blog post](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/a-blog-around-the-clock/2013/01/28/commenting-threads-good-bad-or-not-at-all/), on the [Scientific American](http://www.scientificamerican.com/) website, which ruminated on the significance of comment threads, I am further inclined to consider the content of the crowd's responses to my prompt. In presenting isolated excerpts for the crowd to annotate, my project encourages what Katherine Hayles refers to as "hyper attention" in her article, "[Hyper and Deep Attention: The Generational Divide in Cognitive Modes](http://engl449_spring2010_01.commons.yale.edu/files/2009/11/hayles.pdf)." Hayles suggests hyper attention is the more common mode of engagement among people who have grown up immersed in digital technologies. Hyper attention "is characterized by switching focus rapidly among different tasks, preferring multiple information streams, seeking a high level of stimulation, and having a low tolerance for boredom" ([Hayles](http://engl449_spring2010_01.commons.yale.edu/files/2009/11/hayles.pdf) 187). Therefore, my crowd's responses to the excerpts transposes users' online reading habits onto a dense literary text; this is a line of inquiry that Mikka Jacobsen takes a closer look at in her project entitled, "[The Internet, *Ulysses*, and Me: A Cut-Up and Remediated Journey through James Joyce's *Ulysses*](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/Portfolio/jacobsenPortfolio.md)." The blog post on the Scientific American website pushed me to think not only about *how* our hyperattentive pratcices transfer to literary texts, but with the prevalence of comment sections, or unfiltered crowdsourced content that is not dissimilar to my own, I was also prompted to think about what the implications are of reading a text alongside a range of user comments. The blog post suggests that an article with strongly polarized and impassioned comment threads will lead readers to misinterpret the corresponding article because they prompt readers to develop their own opinions/place themselves on one end of the continuum before duly considering the article; alternatively, the same article with neutral comments gave rise to less polarized appraisals of the article. Perhaps if the polarity of the comments influences both reader comprehension and response, so too might the content of comments I received on the excerpts of *Ulysses*. While a study on the psychology of reader response may not be a suitable project to pursue in an English department, to me it is a fascinating area of inquiry that I would like to follow if I had the time and resources available to me.

# Suggestions for Digital Crowdsourced Projects

After my own extended foray into crowdsourcing for my project, I have come up with some recommendations for future crowdsourced academic projects.

[Shakespeare Quarterly]( http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/mcpress/ShakespeareQuarterly_NewMedia/) has taken on the open peer-review with a reasonable amount of success. I have investigated their strategies as well as other large-scale public crowdsourcing projects and have come up with some potential suggestions for how crowdsourcing can be used effectively in academic projects:

* Ask participants to log in before contributing. A login is a simple way of rendering people accountable for their contributions, and will ensure that participants bring their best selves to the table.
* Incorporate a method of self-sufficient moderation. Shakespeare Quarterly’s open peer review allows visitors to the site to comment on other scholars’ comments, which renders it self-moderating.
* Write focused prompts and descriptions. While the conventions for peer review are widely known in the academic community, and are easily transferred to an online forum, other digital projects might request different kinds of contributions and therefore need to be very specific in their mandates.
* Foreground your institutional affiliations. A journal like Shakespeare Quarterly does not need to go out and find contributors—it has a reputable name and a built-in audience that is invested in the journal. Not all projects have these affiliations, though. Therefore, it might be useful to post academic projects in a forum, like [Crowd4U](http://crowd4u.org/), which is home to a variety to a variety of other reputable projects, and attracts users who are willing to contribute their expertise. 
* Implement gameful design. By prompting the crowd to discover a new solution to a problem or discover a gap in scholarship (perhaps for a reward), you encourage them to put in their best effort.
* Whenever possible, crowdsource microtasks—you will gather a more significant number of contributors if tasks are easy to complete.

# Concluding Remarks

* Ultimately, who do you consider the target audience for your project? Who would use it, in what context, and how? 
What are the implications of scholarly projects relying so heavily on voluntary labor as well as a spectrum of investments / expertise?
