#christiePortfolio
* My portfolio is available [here](http://web.uvic.ca/~achris/Ulysses/)
* I've added an alternate version of the site that uses scrolling to navigate between page sections (at the expense of the scrolling sprite). Check it out [here](http://web.uvic.ca/~achris/Ulysses/index2.html)!
* I have tested the site on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. The videos do not currently load in Firefox. Chrome is recommended for viewing the page.
* Please let me know if there are any issues with the page, if things are not rendering properly or if I've missed any broken links. Thanks.
