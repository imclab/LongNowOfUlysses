##How This Becomes That: The Long Now of *Ulysses* Exhibit Guide and Process Manual

*Documents the theories and methods informing the exhibit's creation and curation*. 

**Abstract**
This exhibit guide and process manual documents the projects developed by the graduate students from Engl507, Digital Literary Studies: History and Principles, at the University of Victoria for the Long Now of *Ulysses* exhibit. It remediates the methods used to prototype, test, implement, and publish each exhibit component. Given the recent trends in the Digital Humanities towards a more public facing humanities and making or building as a form of knowledge construction, this project aims to make transparent the theoretical and methodological frameworks informing the collaborative creation and curation of the Long Now of *Ulysses* literary exhibit to enable others to recreate or repurpose the projects for new exhibit contexts. 

# Narrative 
This project documents the exhibit components of the Long Now of *Ulysses* developed by graduate students in Engl507 at the University of Victoria. As an exhibit guide, it catalogues and contextualizes the exhibit components featured in the exhibit space and in online environments. Further, the guide situates the exhibit components within the broader critical contexts of Engl507, the Long Now of *Ulysses*, modernist literary and cultural studies, and digital literary studies. As a process manual, this project provides the instructional framework to enable others to create and curate a literary exhibit using the conceptual, critical, and methodological frameworks informing these exhibit components. Its intermedial design aims for interoperability not only for print and digital mediums but for a diverse audience that includes Humanities scholars, librarians, and cultural heritage professionals. By remediating the work and workflow of my graduate colleagues from Engl507, this process narrative encourages others to recreate and repurpose these projects in new exhibit contexts.
 
Engl507, Digital Literary Studies: History and Principles, is a graduate seminar offered at UVic that explores the conceptual and practical histories of the Digital Humanities. This year (2013), under the mentorship of Dr. Jentery Sayers, students in 507 collaborated to prototype, test, and implement, and publish a single project: The Long Now of *Ulysses*.  The exhibit, curated by Dr.'s Jentery Sayers and Stephen Ross, takes the modernist fascination with time and space as its cornerstone adopting James Joyces’ masterpiece *Ulysses* as its organizing artifact. Using the text as a springboard to introduce visitors to the broad contexts of modernism, the exhibit features excerpts from the text along side rich historical, cultural, and aesthetic materials in a range of analogue and digital media. The exhibit is hosted in the Maltwood Gallery at the UVic McPherson Library and extends into intelligent environments online. Under the mentorship of Dr. Stephen Ross, the exhibit is also co-curated by graduate students from Engl560, Studies in 20th-Century British and Irish Literature. 

Publishing Engl507’s projects in the Long Now of *Ulysses* exhibit provides the opportunity for university and public communities to access and engage with graduate student work. The range and diversity of methods used to design, prototype, and implement each project demonstrates that Humanities research in the English department at UVic -- particularly in Engl507 -- is invested in exploring new technologies, facilitating interdisciplinary collaborations, and contributing to future research opportunities. 

The exhibit guide serves several integral functions. First, it provides the exhibit goers with the critical and cultural frameworks under which the exhibit and the exhibit components were designed, by whom, and for what purpose. The Preface and Introduction sections in the guide contextualize the exhibit within the broader frameworks of *Ulysses*, modernism, digital literary studies, and graduate research in the English Department at UVic. In the spirit of creating a more friendly, public-facing humanities project, it aims to make the theories and methods transparent so that exhibit goers can appreciate not only the aesthetic of each project, but also the critical context informing its design. In this sense, my exhibit guide actively mediates the discursive boundary between digital literary studies in Engl507 (in particular), humanities scholarship (in general), and provides potential for outside future scholarship. 

Along with the scholarly cultural context of the exhibit, my project engages with the remediation process of Engl507 by creating a ‘living’ archive of our documents and artefacts. As an intercessor for each exhibit component, my project continuously envisions how to document the thoughts, projects, and seminar inquiries that inform the Long Now of *Ulysses*. By documenting and remediating these projects, I aim to preserve a record of these projects and mediate access to and engagement with them beyond the life of the exhibit. By documenting these projects and the methods used to design and develop them I aim to preserve not only the projects themselves, but the diversity of research and scholarship in graduate student work in Engl507. This project is, thus, more an experimentation of crafting and curating a dynamic record of collaboration and process. In the Engl507 panel presentations, Alicia Hubka referred to this process as digital witnessing. Under these terms, my project is, paradoxically, invested in maintaining an integrative and flexible system of documentation. 

This project is invested not only in *remediating* the projects and processes of the exhibit, but in *transmitting* them into new exhibit contexts. By providing the methodological framework for each project, my project emphasizes the value of process over product, encourages the creation and curation of future literary exhibits, and fosters and facilitates new opportunities for collaborative scholarship. 

Implicit in my process manual is the argument that things – maps, websites, books, exhibits, etc. – are not only the subject of or tools for scholarly research, but that making, designing, and building things are academic endeavors. In traditional modes of scholarship, the products of making (art, stories, etc) are typically the objects of analysis that critics study and interpret; however, oftentimes these artefacts contain an argument of their own. The projects developed in Engl507 have been designed and produced within a critical context. Each project puts forth an argument that contributes not only to the critical framework of the Digital Humanities, but also to the literary scholarship of *Ulysses* and modernism. Elements of an academic essay (argument, evidence, and conclusion) are structured into the artefact. To read more about this mode of scholarship and its significance to and implications in Digital Humanities projects, see Stan Ruecker’s [How a Prototype Argues](http://individual.utoronto.ca/alangaley/files/publications/Galey_Ruecker_prototypes.pdf). As a process narrative, this project argues for a more transparent, public facing humanities whereby scholars make their work and workflows accessible to public audiences and whereby the process of scholarship has equal value alongside the product of scholarship. By making the th methods and theories of each project explicit, my project invites an open peer-review process by which exhibit goers (both local and distant) can evaluate the exhibit according to academic standards. 

#Reflection Statement
As a guide and process narrative, knowing and doing are almost inextricable in my project. My role as a remediator allowed me to achieve a broad scope of knowledge about each exhibit component and how it developed. By synthesizing formal course assignments (Needs Assessment, Data Models, and the first two Iterations) and remediating them into a version intended for an informed but non-specialized audience, I learned not only about the critical concepts informing each project but the tools and methodologies used to prototype, test, and implement them. During the composition and revision stages, I realized there are certain things you can only know by doing. Knowledge transmission (or teaching) is an embodied practice whereby knowing and doing are synonymous. Although I haven’t actually built a sound repository or used Balsalmiq, as I composed and revised the exhibit components, remediating the methods and workflows became a mode of knowledge acquisition. From a more conceptual level, this is the crux of knowledge transmission. 

I had not anticipated how rewarding this project would be in terms of knowledge acquisition. Before this course I didn’t know that crowdsourcing had so many applications (especially in literary studies), that Google Maps – such a widely used platform – has so many limitations for expressing data, that Mudbox is a sculpting software, that James Joyce wore an eye patch, and (among many, many other things) that astrophysicists have a serious penchant for acronyms (CSDC, EOL, DIETR, ITU, UTC, PMP, FEM, TMM, TRR, EQT, etc). While I’m not sure I’ll ever get the chance to apply some of this knowledge, I couldn’t have known what I do now without having taken on this project.  

Witnessing the conceptual, theoretical, and material progression of each project (and how many of them became interoperable) was a great learning experience. Considering the emphasis on interoperability, praxis, and collaboration in Engl507 (in particular) and the Digital Humanities (in general), I expected that folks would network their projects; however, I was surprised at how projects with widely divergent platforms, purposes, and deliverables became interoperable. For example, I hadn’t imagined the interoperability between Laura’s Timeline project and Alex and Katie’s map of the exhibit artefacts. I was also surprised by the interoperability of some of the technologies. I hadn’t imagined that Laura’s Timeline interface would end up supporting Amanda’s mapping project. 

There were many rewards, surprises, and frustrations that emerged from the collaborative design and methods of my project. Because my project relies on the work of my colleagues, I consistently felt like I was one step behind. For example, I couldn’t develop the process narrative sections until after the first iterations were submitted. By the time the second iteration was due, I had composed the first draft of each project component; however, many workflows had changed dramatically meaning they had to be composed again. For example, three projects had been using Google Maps to visualize their data in the first iteration and by the second iteration each project had switched to a different interface. The degree of change in workflows from one iteration to the next in some projects over the course of the term did come as a surprise to me. 

I really appreciated how the formal log assignments structured the development of the projects. By setting formal parameters and deadlines, Jentery made the developmental expectations explicit. Forthe Needs Assessment, he requested a “polished project description (~150 words) intended for educated, non-expert audiences, including people who may be attending Congress 2013” and “State (in ~50 words) what exactly your project will deliver.” Despite this, I had to mine the texts to extract clear and concise project descriptions as well as deliverables. Mikka, for example, states that her project will deliver a print+ version of *Ulysses* without explaining what print+ is. Dave explains that he will “deliver a web site comprised of one main HTML hub, which will link to nineteen XML pages (expressed through CSS)”. While this demonstrates Dave's expert knowledge of text encoding and web design, his deliverable is void of meaning for those who might not know what HTML, XML, or CSS is. Arthur’s project, “Bloom Vision” didn’t contextualize who – or what – Bloom vision is. Hyperlit is a speculative design project, yet Nina and Jon didn’t define what that means. I was surprised by how many of these assumptions were made in terms of both knowing and doing. Although the Needs Assessments represented the projects early in the conceptual stage, most of these assumptions were not clarified in later iterations. 

My role in remediating the projects was to fill in these gaps in knowledge (first for myself, then for my audience). As a first step, I did a google search for the term, method, or technology. If I couldn’t immediately find the information (as in Mikka’s case) or if the assumption required specialist knowledge (like Mitch’s ESP/MAX patch) I solicited direct feedback through goal-oriented editorial comments (eg – Can you define this term in one sentence or less for a non-specialized audience?). This process made me realize that my colleagues, as Humanities scholars, tend to have difficulty defining and explaining their work to a non-humanities audience.  In terms of the recent argument (especially in the digital humanities) for a more public facing humanities, it would seem there are still some barriers in our own vocabularies and assumptions we need to address in order to make our work accessible to a wider audience. 

#Methods and Documentation
Inasmuch as documentation is the primary method employed in this project, I’ve combined the methods and documentation sections of this portfolio. The following paragraphs outline my project’s development. Where applicable, I’ve added links to intermedial resources that document various stages of development. For a complete list of documentation sources, see my [documentation data model](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/Logs/DocumentationDataModel.xlsx). 

My project developed according to the formal log assignments outlined in the [Engl507 syllabus](https://github.com/Telka/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/completeSyllabus.md). All formal log assignments were composed using [MarkDown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax and posted into the Engl507 [GitHub repository](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/tree/master/English507) (with the exception of my second iteration, noted below). GitHub is a web-based project management platform with a revision control system. Jentery hosted a short workshop during the second seminar to teach us how the interface worked. He also circulated a Mark Down cheat sheet. Throughout the term, I typically composed my logs in Word and then transferred my work (copy and paste functions) to [Text Wrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) where I applied the Mark Down syntax (because Word has a much friendlier aesthetic than Text Wranger). Despite some difficulties committing files, GitHub worked well to host the collaborative, iterative development of the Long Now of *Ulysses* exhibit. 

The first log assignment asked us to research and reflect upon digital research methods. Jentery asked us to read [William Turkel’s A Workflow for Digital Research Using Off-the-Shelf Tools](http://williamjturkel.net/how-to/), test out some apps, and develop our own workflow for the course. You can find my workflow [here](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/Workflow/TelkaWorkflow.md). In addition, here is a photo that represents my digital and analogue hybrid methods ![](http://i.imgur.com/t2fGCeq.jpg?1) and a concept map representing my workflow ![](http://i.imgur.com/ET2XXNP.jpg). 

Next, Jentery asked us to revise the Long Now of *Ulysses* prospectus to reflect what we wanted to contribute to the exhibit. By this time (week three of the course), I knew I wanted to explore my pedagogical interests with some sort of outreach project that could destabilize the elitist foundation of the University (in general) and engage the local community (public libraries, museums, galleries) in humanities research, but I hadn’t decided what form that would take. You can compare  [mine](https://github.com/Telka/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/Logs/Telkaprospectus.md) with [Stephen Ross’s original](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/ThoughtPiece/prospectus.md). 

After reading [Jentery’s feedback](https://github.com/Telka/LongNowOf*Ulysses*/blob/master/English507/Feedback/feedbackThoughtPieces.md), I scheduled an appointment with him in hopes of determining a particular focus for my project. When he suggested a documentation manual, I thought it was a great way to incorporate my interests and collaborate with my colleagues. After this, Jentery and I met regularly throughout the term. I documented the dates, topics, and outcomes of these meetings in a [spreadsheet](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOf*Ulysses*/blob/master/English507/Logs/TelkaAndJenteryMeetingsDataModel.xlsx). 

The next log, a Needs Assessment, required a polished project description along with a list of resources, a clear deliverable, milestones, and a timeline, as well as what we hoped to learn. You can read my Needs Assessment [here](https://github.com/Telka/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/NeedsAssessment/TelkaNeeds%20Assessment%20Log.md) along with [Jentery’s feedback](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/Feedback/feedbackNeedsAssessments.md). 

Now that each project had a clear deliverable and timeline, Jentery asked us to model and structure our data. I used Excel for my data model (which included the project titles, author’s name, resources, deliverable, timeline/milestones, and a list of actionables for myself. Here, I harvested details about each project from each [Needs Assessment log](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/tree/master/English507/NeedsAssessment) in the GitHub repo. You can see my data model [here](https://github.com/Telka/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/TelkaDataModel.xlsx). The last column of my data model sets up some explicit tasks for the next stage of development and asks for clarification about particular element of some projects I didn’t understand. 

The structure of these log assignments really helped develop my own project goals. Having a clear sense of how each project would develop and under what timeframe, I created a [GANTT chart](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/Logs/Telka507ExhibitGuideGANTT.xlsx) to manage my project's development. I made a similar [chart](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/Logs/TelkaPortfolioGANTT%20.xlsx) (but with more detail) to manage this portfolio. 

The next stage of development was to actually create a prototype, or first draft. To inform the structural elements of my project, I turned to the [NINCH GUIDE](file://localhost/%5BNINCHguide%5D(http/::www.nyu.edu:its:pubs:pdfs:NINCH_Guide_to_Good_Practice.pdf) and to the [Canadian Cultural Heritage Network’s Professional Exchange](http://www.pro.rcip-chin.gc.ca/index-eng.jsp), and the [Orlando Project's documentation page](http://orlando.cambridge.org/public/svDocumentation?formname=t&d_id=GOINGELECTRONIC) for more information about documenting, preserving, and remediating cultural artefacts as well as for examples writing in a documentation genre. 

To structure my document, I analyzed the formal or structural elements of the NINCH Guide and identified the purpose of each section or paragraph relevant to the exhibit documentation. Then, I mapped them out with specific content using [Inspirations](http://www.inspiration.com/). You’ll find a mindmap of the blueprint [here](http://imgur.com/ucjL4WM). This map became the formal structure for my exhibit guide. I inserted the section headings in a Word document and composed my first draft. I submitted this draft (along with a few other formal elements Jentery requested for the fifth formal log assignment) to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/IterationOne/telkaIterationOne.md). 

At this stage, I posted an informal log in the GitHub repo cataloguing my work to date and a few actionables for the second iteration. You’ll find it [here](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOf*Ulysses*/blob/master/English507/Logs/TelkaLog.md).

My revisions for the second iteration focused primarily on remediating project descriptions (which I harvested from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/tree/master/English507/IterationOne)) and refining the Preface and Introduction sections. For the exhibit component descriptions, I synthesized data from the formal log assignments (especially the Needs Assessments and first iteration) and remediated that data into project descriptions.  Keeping the purpose of my project and my audience in mind, I identified the formal elements I needed for each project and used this formula to structure my editorial process. I structured each section to include: 
1. Project description 
2. Critical framework/justification 
3. Purpose statement 
4. Deliverable
5. Methods/Workflow
6. Future development (when the project itself suggests it)

I planned to circulate this draft to my colleagues to ensure that I had remediated their work accurately. To address ambiguities in the project descriptions and/or workflows, I used the editorial comment bubbles in Word to solicit direct feedback. These were often specific goal oriented questions such as: “Can you define this term for a non-specialist audience in one sentence or less?” 
During my revision process, I used [QuickTime](http://www.apple.com/ca/quicktime/) screencasts to record my editorial strategy and compositional processes. I made one for each project. Then, I edited these videos down to a couple minutes using the QuickTime trim function. I posted these screencasts onto Youtube as documentation of my editorial and compositional process. You can access the screencasts here:

I posted the [second iteration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y36J_MtpVRxLE2Zr2f0Gvt1_khlxyDCqFYgtR0rwZ2c/edit) in Google Drive (rather than GitHub) because of an interoperability issue. Because I made all my revisions in a Word Document and not in Text Wrangler, it would have taken forever to translate the comment bubbles into Mark Down syntax. So, for the collaborative revision, I posted the document in Google Drive and made it public so that anyone with the URL could edit it. I circulated specific [email instructions](http://imgur.com/aYqcrD2) and the link to the document (provided above) to 507’ers for revisions and edits (I also [replicated](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/IterationTwo/TelkaIterationTwo.md) these instructions in a GitHub file titled 'Iteration Two' in case anyone goes looking for it there. The second iteration in google docs is a living document so it looks different today than it did when I initially posted it on March 31, 2013. 

The latest iteration of [my project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y36J_MtpVRxLE2Zr2f0Gvt1_khlxyDCqFYgtR0rwZ2c/edit#) incorporates revisions from the collaborative edit with the 507 gang. I've revised *most* method and workflow sections so that they're current. The only exception (I think) is Amanda's project. She sent an [email](http://imgur.com/CjkzdZ3) suggesting I leave it the way it is. I will, for the time being. I've also included visual documentation for each section and hyperlinked reference sections. In terms of hyperlinking to the GitHub repo, I've (mostly) provided links to the repos to show iterative development (pointing to iteration one, two, and documentation and workflow logs). I'm wondering if we might consider creating repos for each project so that I can provide one link that takes people to a single repo documenting the whole project (or selected elements). Occasionally, I've linked to external documentation sources such as Katie and Alex's documentary vids, Nina and Jon's video, Dave's UVic repo, and Mikka's photo repo. I also refined the preface and introduction. The most noteworthy change here is the addition of a new paragraph in the preface that addresses any 'so what' questions. Finally, I completed the introductions to each exhibit component section (Textual Remediations, New and Old Media, Geotemporal and Geospatical Maps, and Gameful Design). There are still a few lingering comments and questions posted to individuals so I'm keeping it alive in Google Docs.

#FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

This section explores the potential future or future development of the exhibit guide and process manual. 

Before the exhibit launches, this guide *needs* to be: 
1.	distilled into an exhibit finding aid 
2.	be accessible in the gallery
3.	translated into a web-ready document and linked to DC’s exhibit page 
4.	project components need to be reviewed by 507 before the exhibit opening to ensure that everything is up to date and hunky dory. 

Further, the guide *could* be:
1.	expanded to include the work of Egnl560
2.	document the exhibit opening
3.	made accessible to cultural heritage organizations (as a web page?)

Inasumuch as this project invites its audience to replicate and/or repurpose the project components in new exhibit contexts, future development is inherent within the purpose of the guide. I hope that this manual informs the creation and curation of more literary exhibits in universities, galleries, museums, and archives. 

Chris Petter has suggested that the exhibit (and the exhibit guide) may be of interest to the [Access Conference](http://accessconference.ca/2012/10/23/access-2013-will-be-in-newfoundland/) for librarian professionals. The conference is scheduled for September 26-29 in Newfoundland.
