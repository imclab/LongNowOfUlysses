Hi everyone,

My final portfolio is available for your viewing (dis)pleasure at:

http://web.uvic.ca/~dcarlton/portfolio.pdf

Alternatively, you can right clink on the link and download it.

Hopefully this will clarify just what the heck I did over the last few months! It *was* originally around 40 pages long, but I culled it to just under 20, thankfully.

Thanks again for an absolutely fantastic semester!

-David Carlton
