##the metempsychosis of james joyce's *Ulysses*

###location

Please visit my [project website](http://web.uvic.ca/~ahansen/amandahansen/ulyssesAfterlives).


###abstract

ulyssesAfterlives seeks to visualize the *Ulysses* macrotext -- that is, *Ulysses* and its translations and adaptations -- over time by presenting the various versions of the text on a timeline. In addition, the timeline features a map ("The Long Now of *Ulysses*," 2013) which is populated with the geo-coordinates of the same data that populates the timeline. By mapping the afterlives of *Ulysses* over time, this project attempts to analyse the novel's spatial and temporal reach.  


###rationale

I think it is worthwhile to consider the significance of my project to the "Long Now of *Ulysses* Exhibit" on three different levels: the text, the exhibit, and the field of digital humanities (DH). For clarity's sake, I have split my rationale into sections according to those levels.    

####the text

Joyce critic Karen R. Lawrence likens the translations of *Ulysses* to the motif of metempsychosis (the transmigration of souls) which pervades *Ulysses*, characterizing the translation process as carrying texts "metempsychotically across cultural, linguistic, national, and gender divides" (1). By highlighting the various translations and adaptations of *Ulysses* since its publication in 1922 -- what Patrick O'Neill calls the "macrotext" (10) -- my project visualizes the continuation of that motif beyond the novel and into the "long now." Moreover, by including digital adaptations -- such as **Ulysses** SEEN, recent Twitter adaptations (Twitterature), and Alicia Hubka's satellite project -- my project represents the transmigration of *Ulysses* to new media forms. 

####the exhibit

At its heart, the "Long Now of *Ulysses* Exhibit" assumes that James Joyce's *Ulysses* is both universal and relevant. Indeed, the exhibit prospectus refers to *Ulysses* as "the sine qua non of high modernist literary production . . . [which] formed part of the context for, and was contextualised by, virtually every significant aspect of modernist cultural production" (Ross). One of my objectives in creating a geo-temporal expression of the translations and adaptations of *Ulysses* was to challenge that assumption by visualizing the scope of the *Ulysses* macrotext. Moreover, because the exhibit prospectus also highlights the modernist fascination with time and space, geo-temporal expression seemed like a logical avenue through which to examine *Ulysses*.   

Initially, I intended to create a complete geo-temporal exhibit that would analyse the intersection of space and time in *Ulysses*'s afterlives. Because of the lack of access to an adequate geo-temporal application (Neatline), I was forced to abandon either time or space; I chose space. Although the "geo" aspect of my project has been somewhat diminished by my decision to use TimelineJS, I have been able to include the map that I created using Google Spreadsheet Mapper 3.0 in my timeline. Populated with the geo-coordinates of the same data which populates my timeline, this map visualizes the geographic scope of the *Ulysses* macrotext, ultimately underscoring the idea that its scope is not all that global.

While TimelineJS arguably limits my ability to critically frame ulyssesAfterlives, I am confident that there is value in seeing the versions/adaptations in sequence. In "Humanities Approaches to Interface Theory," Johanna Drucker states that 

>our cognitive ability to make correlations is staggering. We make sense of one piece of information or experience in relation to another, stitching fragments of what are graphically related elements together into a narrative, or making our way through unrelated fragments until some chain of compelling connections captures our attention. (4)
	
By limiting the narrative intervention in the project -- with the obvious exception of the role of time as narrative -- I am opening up the *Ulysses* macrotext to the correlative cognitive processes of exhibit patrons. 

Bethany Nowviskie made a similar point in the Neatline workshop she held at the University of Victoria in March 2013. In response to a user asking how to create a narrative for an exhibit, Nowviskie replied that Neatline was designed to limit guided interaction, and to encourage exploration of the material presented. I think this is a virtue of graphical expression -- that it need not be as prescribed as verbal expression, allowing for more interaction and a multitude of interpretations. 

####the field of dh

ulyssesAfterlives engages a major issue in the field of humanities: when is graphical representation meaningful, and when is it simply re-presenting old information (or "whiz bang")? This question is inevitably tied to the ethics of data, or what Drucker calls "capta" ("Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display").  

Drucker addresses the issues of meaning and ethics in "Humanistic Theory and Digital Scholarship." For Drucker, visualizations in the traditional sense (maps, charts, graphs) are misleading because "space and time are constructs, not givens." While this is certainly a reasonable point, I still see value in visualizing capta as long as we acknowledge that the graphical representation is constructed to support a particular view. For example, my map of the translations and adaptations of *Ulysses* is a construction rendered in Google maps that fulfills its purpose by visualizing the rather dramatically limited scope of *Ulysses*'s afterlives. For me, the translations and adaptations must be mapped in order to appreciate how limited *Ulysses*'s global reach really is -- a list of languages and places cannot compete with seeing pins clustered in Europe, North America, and Asia while Africa, South America, and the Middle East are essentially blank.  

Another DH-wide concern that came up for my project is the issue of access to technology. This issue has become increasingly clear to me in this class in particular because of how inaccessible I have found many tools to be based on my personal infrastructure. Further, what really concerns me is that I am an entitled person studying at a good university -- how does this bode for everyone else? Tara McPherson asserts that the technological systems of the post-war era have created "the difficulties we encounter in knitting together our discussions of race (or other modes of difference) with our technological productions within the digital humanities." I have to agree. When discussing this issue in class, someone suggested that we create lo-fi projects that could run on, for example, an old Mac desktop. While I understand the impetus here, I find this suggestion to be troubling: instead of broadening access, we would be creating a two-tiered DH structure which allows those with the most RAM to access everything, while the rest experience a lower quality, low-fidelity experience. As McPherson states, "computers are themselves encoders of culture," giving digital humanists the power to transform culture by improving accessibility instead of perpetuating an inequitable hierarchical system.          


###reflection

Without the slightest hint of exaggeration, I can say that this project challenged me like no other. However, I can also say in total honesty that I have never been more satisfied with what I have learned and done in any other class. 

But was it ever a process. The finding of information for ulyssesAfterlives was not difficult; by now, I am quite adept at research. However, I spent more time than I ever would have imagined on my computer this term, formatting and learning and ruining and adapting. DH work seems to add an element of "doing" that does not exist in traditional literary studies, and for me, that doing took a lot of time and effort. This project underscored for me the conception of DH work as "embodied material practices" (Burgess and Hamming) -- in the humanities at this point, DH work seems to involve the double-duty of the intellectual and the material.   

Aside from the labour aspect of this project, my main challenge was failure. Coming from fairly traditional background in literature studies -- I have tech experience, but not in the terms of DH -- I have internalized the emphasis on polish over practice. After having "failed" many times during my work on this project, and feeling more competent and resilient for having done so, I am inclined to view DH work as what Anne Burdick, et al call "the Generative Humanities" (5). I see incredible promise in the "rapid cycles of prototyping and testing . . . [the] willingness to embrace productive failure, and the realization that any 'solutions' generated within the Digital Humanities will spawn new 'problems'" (Burdick, et al 5).   

This prototyping, testing, and productive failure certainly characterizes my project. After working with one data model for weeks and failing to make it what I wanted it to be, I ended up changing my project altogether. My success with Google Spreadsheet Mapper 3.0 and Google Earth (fig. 1) was limited, so I decided that I wanted to try to use [Neatline](http://neatline.org/). I managed to install and run [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html) and [Omeka](http://omeka.org/), but the Neatline plug-in would not work with my operating system -- even though it was successfully installed, I could not use it (fig. 2). At that point, I knew that I could either go back to Google Earth, which with I was not happy, or try something new. That something ended up being [TimelineJS](http://timeline.verite.co/), which is my current project interface. As an added bonus, I discovered that much of my metadata was reusable in my new data model (fig. 3), which saved me considerable time and labour.    

Ultimately, this process of testing, failing, and adapting ended up being what worked best about my project. If I had enjoyed a seamlessly successful experience with Spreadsheet Mapper and Google Earth, I would not have gained the invaluable experience I have with FTP, HTML, MySQL, and PHP. Although I am by no means an expert in any of these areas, I did manage to create and configure a Wordpress.org site, and get it up and running on my UVic web space through that process of trial and error (fig. 4).

###future development

I am also convinced that there is value in performing a small-scale distant reading of a macrotext. In "Conjectures on World Literature," Franco Moretti summarizes his work on the modern novel, which resulted in the "law" that a culture's move towards the novel means "a compromise between foreign form and local material." In the future, for the *Ulysses* macrotext, I think it might be useful to look for similarities in the social and political contexts in each country at the point of translation. Given the novel's reputation and the obscenity trials, what happened in each culture or nation to permit the translation of *Ulysses* at a particular point in time? 

According to Moretti's model, I would have to "define a unit of analysis" -- for Moretti and the modern novel, it was "the formal compromise" -- and then "follow its metamorphoses." In following the translations of *Ulysses* in their social and political (and legal?) contexts, I would likely find valuable insights into twentieth-century global literary cultures. The graphical representations -- my timeline and map -- are the ideal starting point for that type of distant analysis. Moreover, using graphical expression in this way, as a potential  starting point for further inquiry, might ameliorate some of Drucker's wariness of "the fallback position of taking timelines as an adequate measure on which to map the complexities of historical and aesthetic experience" ("Humanistic Theory"). 

A future iteration of this project might also look at language groups rather than place of publishing. A translation of *Ulysses* into Spanish in Mexico City, for example, might be read in many Spanish-speaking countries; this possibility is not included in my map because of the limits of time and scope. I acknowledge this gap in my project, as I was only concerned with places and not realms of influence -- looking at languages of translation would allow a more accurate representation of *Ulysses* afterlives.
