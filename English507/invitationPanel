#Invitation to In-Process Panels (2 April 2013) | emailed 30 March 2013

Hello, everyone. I hope you're enjoying this wonderful weather. 

I'm writing to invite you to four graduate student panel presentations emerging from this semester's version of English 507: Digital Literary Studies. The details for each panel --- including the date, time, location, panelists, and topics --- are below my signature.

Since we're sure you're quite busy at this hectic moment in the semester, we invite you to attend the panel or panels amenable to your schedule. For your reference, we've included rough start times and topics for the panels, each of which will be followed by a brief (~10-minute) question and answer period. 

Thanks again for your time, and all the best to you as the semester nears a close. 

Sincerely,
Jentery

"Digital Literary Studies: A Cluster of In-Process Panels Highlighting Graduate Student Work"
Tuesday, 2 April 2013, 2:10 - 4:20
Halpern Centre (Grad Centre) 108 and 112 (combined)

What is the value of digital literary studies in our educational climate? What are some example projects that demonstrate how and why to think through the intersections of literature, culture, and computation? This cluster of four graduate student panels will address these very questions by not only exhibiting projects from English 507: Digital Literary Studies but also reflecting on the various methods, processes, surprises, and decisions involved in hybrid research practices. Each in-process panel is anchored in the forthcoming exhibit, "The Long Now of Ulysses," which opens in the Maltwood Gallery (McPherson Library) Friday, May 17th. Throughout the semester, graduate students in English 507 have been developing projects intended for the Long Now exhibit by investigating the role of physical gallery spaces in web-oriented times. How should a literary exhibit be occupied? How should it exist and persist across online and offline environments? How can it afford interpretations, experiences, and social relations distinct from now ubiquitous, screen-based activities? The starting point for these questions is a canonical novel that challenges us to think beyond our increasingly short nows and to engage time, space, and the book as materials made for speculating beyond the immediate. 

Panels, Panelists, and Topics:

2:10-2:45: Nina Belojevic, Laura Dosky, Mikka Jacobsen, and Jon Johnson (topics: gameful design, crowdsourcing interpretation, temporal expression, the post-internet book)

2:45-3:20: Alex Christie, Amanda Hansen, Tim Personn, and Katie Tanigawa (topics: geotemporal expression, desktop fabrication, adaptation, translation, network analysis)

3:20-3:50: Arthur Hain, Mitch Renaud, and Zaqir Virani (topics: media archaeology, photogrammetry, physical computing, sound studies)

3:50-4:20: David Carlton, Telka Duxbury, and Alicia Hubka (topics: text encoding, process narratives, interoperability, Ulysses in low Earth orbit)
