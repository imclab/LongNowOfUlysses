# Bloom Vision: Iteration Two  

25 March, 2013  

The stereoscope is now stained and assembled:

I'm keeping it at the Maker Lab for now, and will bring it to our final roundtable presentations next week (I would bring it to class, but space is limited and I'm trying to minimize wear until the exhibit goes live).  

As for the 3D model, I've taken several photographs for each component (metadata available via my [revised data model](https://drive.google.com/?tab=mo&authuser=0#folders/0B1d25Z0nufmWdjRMdFJucnJDRU0)), and have started to stitch them together into 3D models. As of now, I've captured the top and bottom pieces of the card slide:

I've also been filming the above processes for inclusion in my final portfolio.  

So what remains? I still have to make 3D models for the remaining six stereoscope components, print and test images, and edit a final video mini-doc of the project. I've obtained high-res scans of the Gis√®le Freund collection, but I still need to do the work of duplicating, altering, and re-printing select images. I am also still looking to include photographs from other sources.  

Check out my [log](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/Logs/HainLog.md) for more media and details pertaining to the above.
