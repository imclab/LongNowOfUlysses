##Iteration Two

This iteration invites exhibit contributors to revise and edit my remediations of each project components. I've asked Jentery to circulate the draft as a word document. I've published a second draft of this same document in [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B48gE5926OujX055ck5vbXZpNFE/edit). Please use the attached word document as a reference document only. Do not revise this draft. Please make your revisions in the Google Drive doc. To recap our convo last Tuesday, the attached word doc includes specific editorial comments (on which I hope you'll base some of your revisions) that I couldn't upload with the Google Drive doc (sigh). In addition to my editorial comments, please also read your project component section closely to ensure that I haven't misrepresented your work or workflow. Considring much of the workflow has changed since your first iterations, please update these sections to reflect your current work. 

I've structured each remediation to include:  

1. Project description 
2. Critical framework/justification 
3. Purpose statement 
4. Deliverable
5. Methods/Workflow
6. Future development (when the project itself suggests it)

Perhaps you can make sure that I've accurately reflected and cogently expressed these structural elements in each section.  

If you have a few moments, I'd love to hear what you think of the preface and introduction. Consider how I'm situating the exhibit and this process narrative in terms of a critical framework (the Long Now, modernism, and DH) and in terms of how a non-specialist audience might read/use this doc. Your feedback is welcome!

Please note: I still need to add documentation resources and visualizations. I'll include those in the next draft which will be circulated before the end of the term. You will, of course, be welcome to review and revise that draft as well.
