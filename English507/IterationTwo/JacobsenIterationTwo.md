# Iteration Two: Material Problems

I faced a pretty major set back between the last time we circulated our draft components and now. I was about half way through cutting up my text, and things were going fairly well, when I noticed a lot of pages very loose in their binding. The book is a used copy and appears to have had more than one reader flip through its pages. With such a severe break of the spine forced upon the binding every time I cut out words and cross out lines, on top of all of the years and hands and eyes the pages have seen, and the crackling crusty glue that seems to turn to dust even as you look at it, the book just couldn't keep itself together (see image: !["broken spine"](http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/18/brokenspine.jpg/)). Right about mid-*Ulysses*, pages started falling out, casually, one by one.

At first I tried gluing the pages and the binding back together. It seemed to work okay for a while, although its bulging remnants were ruining the aesthetics, looking like some oozy skin shed by the Blob (see image !["the Blob"](http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/201/theblob.jpg/)). Even then, the glue eventually just wouldn't hold. So, I gave up the fight and resigned to begin again.

I set out to find another cheap, used copy, but one that was sewn and bound (see image: ["sewn and bound"](http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/14/sewnandbound.jpg/)). I luckily found a nice looking hardcover, Modern Library's 1934 edition, for only ten dollars (See image !["Modern Library](http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/853/modernlibrary.jpg/) and ![ML2](http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/820/ml2ih.jpg/)"). 

Starting again has already allowed for some interesting surprises. Firstly, this particular edition is fairly different from all others I have seen. For example, the first chapter begins with "Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead..." Not stately! Not plump! Just Buck Mulligan (See image !["Buck Mulligan"](http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/259/buckmulligan.jpg/)). Secondly, all of my cuts appear in different places. Which, when you think about it, makes total sense. The typset and pagination and size of the book are all different, and words and spaces are of course in different places. So, the outcome will be changed entirely, which is interesting in itself.

With the new book, I have only cut up and reworked about fifty pages so far. It is painstaking and time consuming, striking through all of those lines of text (see image: !["strike through"](http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/69/strikethrough.jpg/)). Funnily enough, my mind keeps wandering to the strike-through function of a word processor, and I  dream of how easy, how split-second it would be, to cross through all of these lines at once. And I don't let my mind wander too much, or I am bound to make some mistake and strike the wrong set of lines! I am not joking when I say I am getting muscle strain in my forearms from holding a pen and ruler aloft at odd angles for hours at a time.

Beyond the time and exertion of the project, I am starting to question its value. What will it do? Will it allow me to assert any type of argument? Make any interpretive claims? Will it be legible to its reader? What will it tell him or her in the end? Anything at all? I hope that I will be able to get through the whole book, and I hope that I will be able to find some compelling links and narratives revealing themselves. Until then, I have to just keep slogging through the process.

As of now, I am enjoying the poetics of the assembled lines of cut-out words. Maybe this will turn out to be the best part of all. The startling and surprising beauty of random pieces of narrative. What might they say, in the end? Here's what I've got so far:

*blessed lips.*
*Bray Head brooding hoarsened feet.*
*fifty-five held rotto*
*Yes. problem. pull*

*thimble the Greeks
starred Paris 
some.
had goose softly,
she sheep, Plasters
-No: piano dressing lengthwise*

Thinking about the exhibit, I am now wondering how and where my piece will be displayed. All in all, it won't take up much space, and its set up is rather simple compared to some of the other projects, but I suppose I will need to have a sort of plan for implementation. How much I will need to explain the piece? How much do I want to?
