[This](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/11381261/NetworkedUlyssesIteration2.html) is the most recent version of my project *Networked Ulysses.* It now involves three different views (Map, Timeline, List), which I implemented using the Exhibit technology created by MIT's Simile project, a fourth network (Dublin), and a near-complete list of contributors to Joyce's novel (which is not to say that there could ever be any closure with a project of this kind, just that, at some point in the very near future, I will make the call that the networks now provide an *interesting* angle on the production of *Ulysses*).
