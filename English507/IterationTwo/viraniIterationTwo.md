# Iteration Two

For this second round of my draft components, I present the same [spreadsheet of Dublin Core Metadata](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmC4guPyb1GedHB0NnBGQmZUbkVxczJ1X1lOTHdfMlE&usp=sharing) and the same [open DropBox of raw audio](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/01rtkhlf7jw3yvb/A4ftOaamD1) in their up-to-date states. 

What's next? General connections must still be made, in that the Geo's, XML, and KML must be disseminated. The audio seems to have been sent around appropriately where it was needed, and the remaining songs to be added are all pop culture music and classical, so serve only the needs of this project. 


Considering that the new goal is entirely functionality and providing content for others, here is an example of the features of the spreadsheet through the magic of screenshots.

The sound "Molly's Theme (variants 1-3) attaches to these two sets of coordinates

Odyssey is the location at which the sound itself was recorded, and technically physically stored
