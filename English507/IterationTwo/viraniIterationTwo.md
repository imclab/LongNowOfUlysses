# Iteration Two

For this second round of my draft components, I present the same [spreadsheet of Dublin Core Metadata](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmC4guPyb1GedHB0NnBGQmZUbkVxczJ1X1lOTHdfMlE&usp=sharing) and the same [open DropBox of raw audio](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/01rtkhlf7jw3yvb/A4ftOaamD1) in their up-to-date states. 

What's next? General connections must still be made, in that the Geo's, XML, and KML must be disseminated. The audio seems to have been sent around appropriately where it was needed, and the remaining songs to be added are all pop culture music and classical, so serve only the needs of this project.
