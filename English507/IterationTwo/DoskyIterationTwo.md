## Iteration Two

Things have changed a little bit since the last time we workshopped our projects. Because I have been having so much trouble getting responses from people and will no longer be able to plot each of the excerpts on a single timeline (so far only a few excerpts have enough annotations to be published), I have decided to modify the way that I am using the Timeline.js. As it stands right now the timeline will no longer plot the hours in a day; rather, it will be used to visualize how readers contextualize "The Long Now." I have tagged each of the responses that I have received in terms of the particular word or phrase on which they have based their annotation. These tags appear as vertically stacked bars that sub-divide the timeline. Next, each of the annotations has been plotted based on *when* it appeared in history. For example, the song "London's Burning" by the Clash would appear on the timeline in April 1977 because that is when the song is released. The remaining annotations have been tagged and ploted in the same fashion. I recognize that this will involve some revision to the rationale I have already mapped out, but I also believe this change is necessary--it doesn't make sense to plot only three episodes on a timeline that is supposed to mark the hours in a day. Maybe I can revert to my original model if I gather enough annotations before congress.

I have also started working on a wordpress site that will act as a home for my timeline. It is lacking a great number of bells and whistles as the moment, but it's well on its way to being a functional site, I think. Since I plan on installing some of the content from my timelines in the Maltwood Gallery on a rotating schedule, I think it makes sense to set up my work as a blog, which will also be dynamic. The blog will reflect the interactive nature of my project and will also change with the actual exhibit space. On the homepage visitors are able to read the introduction and rationale for my project, and there is also a link that leads to a form where they can contribute their annotations. The excerpt to which the prompt links will change as a gather enough annotations. Additionally, a new timeline will be posted for annotated excerpts as soon as I receive enough annotations. Below are screen grabs of my current site. (I've included screen grabs as opposed to pointing you to the actual site because it has not been published to the web--I am working on it locally).

In the coming weeks I will.. 

1. continue to find more respondents
2. Revise my rationale if I find I am *still* not getting enough responses to make my original model work
3. Work on the WordPress site.
4. Iron out some of the technical issues I am having (embedding Timeline.js into my WordPress site, publishing site to the web
5. Maybe it's about time that I come up with a concrete plan in relation to what I will put in the actual exhibit space? Yes? Yes.
