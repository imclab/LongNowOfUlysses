# Iteration Two

## Visibility of Process:
  
I am thinking about creating a small, discreet explanation of what is going on with the sound. On it I am thinking about having the tagline, abstract, a screen grab of the patch, and explanation of the types of sounds of how they're triggered. For the second iteration I would like to get feedback on what should and shouldn't be included on this page. 


## Abstract: 
  
Sound is inherently ephemeral as it is always already engaged in decay. By (re-)sounding sonic ephemera from and adjacent to Ulysses I will create a space where the viewer/listener is encouraged to linger and play with sounds of Joyce's novel through their position in the exhibit. 


## Tagline: 
  
Ephemeris: sound bank responding to bodies in space

## Explanation:
  
There are four layers of ephemera that can be activated by approaching a panel: short sounds that appear in the text excerpt, speech of the except being read (or Joyce reading), period performances of music from the novel, and longer ambient sounds. All four wont necessarily be triggered upon each approach and there are multiple files possible in each registar. Approach a panel and see what you get. Go away. Then come back and hear some more.

## Questions for Workshop:
   
  	1 - Are these blurbs clear enough to be meaningful yet assimilable in an exhibit 
	    setting?  
	2 - What would the value of seeing a screen grab of the patch?   
	3 - Thoughts on the new title: Sonic-Ephemeris: Ulysses
