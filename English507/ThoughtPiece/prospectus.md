# Prospectus for “The Long Now of *Ulysses*”

Co-curated by Jentery Sayers, Stephen Ross, English 507 (Spring 2013), and English 560 (Spring 2013)

Author: Stephen Ross 

## Rationale

“The Long Now of *Ulysses*” takes the modernist fascination with time and space as its cornerstone, using James Joyce’s modernist masterpiece *Ulysses* as a springboard for presentation of a rich context of historical, cultural, and aesthetic materials in a range of analogue and digital media. It will introduce visitors to the broad contexts of modernism even as it brings to light both the everyday content and the avant-garde stylistic dimensions of the novel. The exhibit takes *Ulysses* as its starting point for several reasons: we have it and are concluding the first-ever publication of it online, it’s perhaps the sine qua non of high modernist literary production (barring only *The Waste Land*), and it was at the very centre of a dizzyingly productive time and place -- Paris in the 1910s and 1920s -- and formed part of the context for, and was contextualised by, virtually every significant aspect of modernist cultural production. As such, it is not simply an instance of modernism, but perhaps its key metonym: the part that can stand for the whole, directing us out from its centrality to the rich context in which it emerged and which it in turn helped shape. In this respect, and as the ongoing fascination with modernist aesthetics demonstrates (e.g., the popularity of *Mad Men*, the recent worldwide tour of the Vorticist exhibit), we remain firmly in the long now of *Ulysses* even today. This exhibit will extend this long now across media, times, and places to suggest ways in which we might still treat *Ulysses* as a springboard into the cultures of modernity and even postmodernity.  

## Curation

The exhibit will be co-curated by Drs. Jentery Sayers and Stephen Ross, who will oversee the creative and collaborative contributions of the graduate students in Dr. Sayers' English 507 course (“Introduction to Digital Humanities”) and Dr. Ross's English 560 course ("The Modernist Novel"). Although the exhibit is a collaborative endeavour, the students in English 507 will oversee exhibit methodologies, which will include but are not limited to digital elements and intelligent environments. Working in conjunction with faculty and English 507, the students in English 560 will be responsible for sourcing and contextualising exhibit assets. 

## Organization

The exhibit is organized into seventeen panels corresponding to the seventeen display cabinet sections arranged around the perimeter of the exhibit space, and in the six display cabinet sections located in the centre of the space. Each of the perimeter panels corresponds with one of the eighteen episodes of *Ulysses* with the exception of "Wandering Rocks," which will be presented in a wholly digital manner that does not require a panel or cabinet.  

## Perimeter Panels 

Each of the perimeter panels will be arranged around a representation of a  twenty-two-line excerpt from the text. The pages have been chosen by applying an algorithm to the 1922 first edition of the novel as follows: given that the novel is set on June 16, 1904 and was published in 1922, we have taken 6, 16, and 22 as significant numbers. Starting with the first page of each episode, we counted six pages in and sixteen lines down from the top of the page to begin the excerpts we will highlight, and then excerpted 22 lines of text for the representation. This approach means that each panel is constituted by a given text whose significance is the product of a random process, just as modernist works of art increasingly turned to the everyday random experience of the city and rapid-fire technologies for their subject matter. Just as life itself began to feel as though it was blurring for many of the modernists in the first half of the twentieth century, so their works reflected an increased pace in which what Virginia Woolf called “moments of being” were more and more often accidental -- and accidents came to seem more and more significant of a higher order hidden behind superficial chaos. Our method of selecting the passages in which to ground the exhibit mimics this experience, treating *Ulysses* itself as an apparently chaotic welter from which order and significance can be extracted even when -- perhaps especially when -- the particular encounter is itself randomized. 

The selected text is only a springboard, an anchor, for each panel, though, and the exhibit places a premium upon moving beyond the textual alone in its displays. As the attached layout indicates, each panel will feature contextual materials that call out from the excerpts: 

1. using a quotation from later in the book and/or a later work or event that evokes it, we will provide historical context for the passage, the novel, and modernism more broadly. Format: text and/or reproduced photographs or images. 
2. we will link the passage to a character in the novel, his or her historical basis, and the broader network of modernist cultural production in which they participated (and which participated in the production of *Ulysses* by proxy).
3. a visual art work that corresponds or evokes/is evoked by the passage will be hung proximate to the representation of the excerpt from the novel; these works will be selected primarily from the UVAC for their aesthetic correspondence and/or their implication in the network of cultural production that circulated around Joyce and his *Ulysses*. The Gisèle Freund photographs of Paris in the 1920s and 1930s will be of particular interest here, as will the UVAC's Klimt silkscreen and other materials in that vein (all depending upon availability and permission).  
4. an object or artifact that has been reproduced in 3D; these objects will be selected based upon their appearance in the novel, their contextual importance, and their interest factor as historical objects. We will model the objects from existing digital models/scans or scan objects from museum collections to which we have been given access (including UVAC) for this purpose. The objects will be printed on a MakerBot 3D printer (housed in the Maker Lab at UVic) in a resinous material, meaning that they can be freely handled by visitors to the exhibit without fear of damage or loss (should either occur, we will simply print replacements).  
5. sounds/music that correspond to the contexts will be available for playback. These will include historical recordings of soundscapes from the early twentieth century as well as songs, music, voices, readings, and machines. 
6. other texts that are evoked by/evoke the excerpt will themselves be presented in excerpts and, where possible, in the original or rare editions held by Special Collections (in the locked display cases). At a minimum these will include rare editions of *Ulysses*, but also works by Wyndham Lewis, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, John Betjeman, Herbert Read, Amelia Laracuen, letters, diaries, advertisements, newspaper pages (we have the 1904 Freeman, e.g.), etc.
7. digital representations providing contemporary or experiential components that complement the analogue elements of the excerpt (these might include geotemporal visualizations or social media applications).
8. other sensory assets that will create layers of experiences; these might include olfactory or tactile elements, such as perfume or fabric.   

## Centre Cabinets

The six cabinets located in the centre of the space are organized according to the principle of unanticipated afterlives. They will feature works in which artists and critics have taken up *Ulysses* and its contexts in ways Joyce could not have anticipated: digital manifestations, cinematic renderings, live performances, architectural designs, artistic appropriations, inventive maps, music, etc. 

## Geotemporal Representations

As an extension of the centre cabinet display, we will be creating a geotemporal representation of the unanticipated afterlives of *Ulysses* using Neatline. This digital exhibit will map the various iterations of *Ulysses* (e.g., editions, translations, film adaptations), as well as the architecture, festivals, societies, journals, etc. inspired by or dedicated to *Ulysses*. Each mapped point will include a brief annotation that will explain the event/site/iteration in relation to the text. In providing a visual representation of *Ulysses*' spatial and global reach, this exhibit will act as a digital echo of the modernist fascination with time and space which is fundamental the novel. For an example of a Neatline exhibit, visit [I am it, and it is I -- Lovecraft in Providence](http://lovecraft.scholarslab.org/neatline-exhibits/show/lovecraft-in-providence/fullscreen).      

## Social Media

Episode 10 of *Ulysses*, "Wandering Rocks," features a series of short, simultaneous snapshots from various characters' perspectives. Because the novel form does not allow for synchronic presentation, these simultaneous occurrences are presented in a linear, seemingly chronological format. Social media, however, presents us with the opportunity to compress narrative time and space. Therefore, in order to more closely approximate the simultaneity which serves as the root of the episode, we will create a Facebook timeline of the characters, places, and events in "Wandering Rocks." The preoccupation with time and space was not unique to Joyce; other modernists, including Gertrude Stein, were also invested in the relationship between time and space. This Facebook timeline will link not only to "Wandering Rocks," but also to Stein's foundational essay ["Composition as Explanation](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/learning/essay/238702). Highlighted in this way, the seeming immediacy of social media appears to be a digital incarnation of modernist play in time and space, which situates it within the long now of modernism.
