# Prospectus for “The Long Now of Ulysses”

Co-curated by Jentery Sayers, Stephen Ross, and English 507 (Spring 2013)

Author: Stephen Ross 

## Rationale

“The Long Now of Ulysses” takes the modernist fascination with time and space as its cornerstone, using James Joyce’s modernist masterpiece Ulysses as a springboard for presentation of a rich context of historical, cultural, and aesthetic materials in a range of media. It will introduce visitors to less Euro-centric, global notions of modernism as it brings to light both the everyday content and the avant-garde stylistic dimensions of the novel and broadcasts its temporal and global reach. The exhibit takes Ulysses as its starting point for several reasons: we have it and are concluding the first-ever publication of it online, it’s perhaps the sine qua non of high modernist literary production (barring only The Waste Land), and it was at the very center of a dizzyingly productive time and place -- Paris in the 1910s and 1920s -- and formed part of the context for, and was contextualised by, virtually every significant aspect of modernist cultural production. As such, it is not simply an instance of modernism, but perhaps its key metonym: the part that can stand for the whole, directing us out from its centrality to the rich context in which it emerged and which it in turn helped shape. In this respect, and as the ongoing fascination with modernist aesthetics demonstrates (e.g., the popularity of Mad Men, the recent worldwide tour of the Vorticist exhibit), we remain firmly in the long now of Ulysses even today. This exhibit will extend this long now across media, times, and places to suggest ways in which we might still treat Ulysses as a springboard into the cultures of modernity and even postmodernity. 

## Curation

The exhibit will be co-curated by Dr. Jentery Sayers and Dr. Stephen Ross, who will oversee the creative and collaborative contributions of the graduate students in Dr. Sayers' English 507 course (“Introduction to Digital Humanities”). The curation process will be twofold in that it will involve organizing and documenting materials for the public display, but it will also archive digital data and processes. The students will be responsible for conducting research, assembling artifacts, staging individual panels for the exhibit, composing the accompanying placards and implementing a variety of Web 2.0 technologies to exhibit their research. They will liaise with their colleagues to overcome technological challenges and and will document their methodologies to share with curation teams around the world while collaborating to devise ways of eluding obsolescence. The faculty will take on an executive role and will be responsible for reviewing the content of the exhibit, including selecting the materials to be displayed. 

## Organization

The exhibit is organized into seventeen panels corresponding to the seventeen display cabinet sections arranged around the perimeter of the exhibit space. Each of the perimeter panels corresponds with an hour in the novel, whose episodes occur in approximately one-hour increments over the course of a single day. The first panel will do double duty, displaying the hour of 8:00 am which is narrated twice in episodes 1 and 4 (first from Stephen Dedalus’s perspective and then from Leopold Bloom’s). Additionally, there are six display cabinet sections located in the centre of the space. The remaining six panels will highlight "The Long Now" of Ulysses in a presentation of some of the many ways that Ulysses has permeated a variety of cultures and continues to resonate through time. Each of the displays will strive to welcome audiences that might feel alienated from the novel by drawing connections between the everyday aspects of Ulysses and an assortment of well-known historical moments and cultural icons.

## Perimeter Panels 

Each of the perimeter panels will be arranged around a large blow-up of twenty-two lines from a page in the novel. The pages have been chosen by applying an algorithm to the 1922 first edition of the novel as follows: given that the novel is set on June 16, 1904 and was published in 1922, we have taken 6, 16, and 22 as the key terms of the algorithm. Starting with the first page of each episode, we counted six pages in and sixteen lines down from the top of the page to begin the excerpts we’ll blow up, and then excerpted 22 lines of text for the poster. Although the excerpts have been selected by the algorithm, there is a certain degree of arbitrariness about the selections as a single algorithm has been applied to each chapter. This approach means that each panel is constituted by a given text whose significance is selected for by the algorithm, just as modernist works of art increasingly turned to the everyday random experience of the city and rapid-fire technologies for their subject matter. Just as life itself began to feel as though it was blurring for many of the modernists in the first half of the twentieth century, so their works reflected an increased pace in which what Virginia Woolf called “moments of being” were more and more often accidental -- and accidents came to seem more and more significant of a higher order hidden behind superficial chaos. Our method of selecting the passages to blow up for the exhibit mimics this experience, treating Ulysses itself as an apparently chaotic welter from which order and significance can be extracted even when -- perhaps especially when -- the particular encounter is itself randomized. The algorithmic selections will emphasize the extent to which Ulysses is concerned with the everyday and will complement the title of the exhibit in that they will spotlight even the minutiae of the text as wrapped up in "The Long Now".

The blown-up text is only a springboard, an anchor, for each panel, though, and the exhibit places a premium upon moving beyond the textual alone in its displays. As the attached layout indicates, each panel will feature some of the following contextual materials that call out from the posterized excerpts: 

1. using a quotation from later in the book and/or a later work that evokes it, we will provide historical context for the passage, the novel, and modernism more broadly. Format: text and/or reproduced photographs or images. 
2. we will link the passage to a character in the novel, his or her historical basis, and the broader network of modernist cultural production in which they participated (and which participated in the production of Ulysses by proxy)
3. a visual art work that corresponds or evokes/is evoked by the passage will be hung proximate to the blown-up excerpt from the novel; these works will be selected primarily from the UVAC for their aesthetic correspondence and/or their implication in the network of cultural production that circulated around Joyce and his Ulysses. The Gisèle Freund photographs of Paris in the 1920s and 1930s will be of particular interest here, as will the UVAC's Klimt silkscreen and other materials in that vein (all depending upon availability and permission).  
4. an object or artifact that has been reproduced in 3D; these objects will be selected based upon their appearance in the novel, their contextual importance, and their interest factor as historical objects. We will model the objects from existing digital models/scans or scan objects from museum collections to which we have been given access (including UVAC) for this purpose. The objects will be printed on a MakerBot 3D printer (housed in the Maker Lab at UVic) in a resinous material, meaning that they can be freely handled by visitors to the exhibit without fear of damage or loss (should either occur, we will simply print replacements).  
5. sounds/music that correspond to the contexts will be available for playback. These will include historical recordings of soundscapes from the early twentieth century as well as songs, music, voices, readings, and machines. 
6. other texts that are evoked by/evoke the blown-up passage will themselves be presented in smaller blow-up excerpts and, where possible, in the original or rare editions held by Special Collections (in the locked display cases). At a minimum these will include rare editions of Ulysses, but also works by Wyndham Lewis, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, John Betjeman, Herbert Read, Amelia Laracuen, letters, diaries, advertisements, newspaper pages (we have the 1904 Freeman, e.g.), etc.
7. interactive media and digital components which will add dimension to the physical space and disrupt typical modes of interaction with the exhibit.
  
## Center Cabinets

The six cabinets located in the center of the space are organized according to the principle of unanticipated afterlives. They will feature works in which artists and critics have taken up Ulysses and its contexts in ways Joyce could not have anticipated: digital manifestations, cinematic renderings, live performances, architectural designs, artistic appropriations, inventive maps, music, etc. The center cabinets will speak to the transcendent quality of Ulysses and its status as cultural capital. Each of the six cabinets will represent a continent (Antarctica will be excluded) and will display allomorphs and impressions of Ulysses from across the globe in a variety of media.

## The Everyday  

A literary exhibit (or any exhibit) should strive to increase the relational aspects of the display and extend its reach beyond the locational space in order to engage attendants in ways that permeate their everyday lives. Thinking in terms of the possibilities that digital media affords, I believe there should be opportunities at an exhibit for the visitors to provide input for the exhibit. The input might then be manifested as significant content in the showcase. 

My goal is to demonstrate that there are aspects of *our* everyday that directly link to the everyday of the novel. Ulysses, while it is thought of as distant and sacred cultural capital, is not so far removed from our everyday. Furthermore, I would like to use my portion of the exhibit as a means of extending the intertextual possibilities of Ulysses. The station I am proposing will signal that the allusions in the text are truly endless by prompting the audience to perform critical close readings of Ulysses with multiple media.

I will develop an arena for commentary using [Timeline JS](http://timeline.verite.co/). Timeline JS is open-source software that can be used to plot a chronology of events and annotate it with multimedia source material found on websites such as [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page), [Google Maps](https://maps.google.ca/), [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/), [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/) and [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/). I will begin by plotting the excerpts of Ulysses on the timeline. The timeline will span the day during which the novel occurs. The timeline will be an online appendage to the exhibit that does not appear as a whole in the physical space of the exhibit, but rather will be an online repository of annotations that will contribute to rotating content in the exhibit. It will also serve as outreach. The digital manifestation of the featured excerpts of Ulysses will ultimately serve as a repository for elements of our everyday that are associated with the significant excerpts of Ulysses. The exhibit-goers will be able to inject fragments of their everyday into Ulysses and create a collaborative critical reading of the text from a contemporary vantage. The end result will bridge the temporal gap that exists between our everyday and the everyday of the novel, and will expose how bound up in one another the two temporally distinct cultures really are. 

My timeline will account for relational conceptions of temporality. Johanna Drucker suggests that "The relational structure of temporality is always constituted according to inflections and variables. Not all days are equal. Or all minutes. Or all hours. Time understood as temporality can be succinctly stated as follows: Temporality=time as a factor of X where X is any variable (fear, speed, anxiety, foreshadowing, regret, reconsideration, narration, etc.)" ([Drucker]<http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html> 10) Bearing Drucker's notion of temporality in mind, the timeline will draw an analog between a single day in *Ulysses* and a single day in the present as visitors to the online extension of the exhibit develop a critical readings of the excerpted passages by annotating them with multiple media. The passages will slowly become saturated with intertextual references that reflect *our* contemporary everyday. Additionally, without the spatial or temporal space of the timeline being modified, the annotated timeline will excavate Ulysses from the past and imbue it with a sense of time that better reflects our current sense of time in a digital age: far more can be accomplished, processed, explored, experienced etc. during a given period.

At this stage, I believe that the most salient issue is coming up with a good mandate for the visitors so that they produce meaningful critical annotations of the text while still linking it to the contemporary everyday. Some questions that I have are:

*  How specific does the prompt need to be in order to solicit meaningful annotations?
*  Do you see any obvious feasibility issues?
*  Do you think it would be best to allow the attendants to annotate any of the excerpts of the text, or do you think the annotations would be more fruitful if the guests were forced to focus on one specific excerpt?
*  Do you have any ideas in terms of how the annotations can contribute to rotating content in the exhibit? Is the idea of curating rotating content feasible?
