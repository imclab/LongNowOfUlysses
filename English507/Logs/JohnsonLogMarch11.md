A big week! As posted by Nina in her log ([https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/Logs/HyperLitLog031113.md]), we demoed our wireframes at the Games Without Frontiers conference for IdeaFest on Saturday. Necessarily, Thursday and Friday were composed of lots of touching up/tweaking wireframes, printing, and figuring out logistics for Saturday. In the end, I think our table looked pretty good (note plant, lamp, bookcase, general scholaryliness)! All of the feedback we received was really positive. There were a few questions/ideas that I heard throughout the day by a variety of people that I think are worth noting. 

"What if I don't use Google Calendar or dayplanners in general?" This is a pretty key point that I think is worth taking into consideration. Not everyone uses Google calendar (myself included). While we have a prompt that suggests that it is easy to sign up for google calendar etc (and it is really quite easy), from a user perspective, I can imagine how this might turn people off; no one wants to have to sign up for another thing in order to access the original thing. I suppose we could incorporate an option where the user plugs their schedule into the app manually. I had a somewhat lengthy discussion about this with a self-confessed "non-dayplanner user" who, while really liking the project, was concerned that this "planner" element might be given a bit too much emphasis. After thinking about it, I think it might work to incorporate a "vague" calendar option, where a user can  guess when during the day they might be able to read within, say, a 2 hour window. A user might want be scheduled to read 30 minutes during this period, and would then receive a reminder every 30 minutes to read (or something) within that window (kind of like an alarm clock with the snooze button). Admittedly, these are things that don't necessarily need to be addressed at this early of a stage, but these are nonetheless worth noting, I think. 

A few people asked whether this was being designed exclusively as an educational tool, and whether or not it was targetted at children. Of course, being Ulysses, it isn't. I'm not sure what to make of this. On the one hand, this app could be very useful as a teaching/educational tool in high schools or universities (there could be an option, for instance, for a highschool to use a unmarked version of "To Kill a Mockingbird" [or something], whereby the class could then annotate it freely, garner discussion, students earn points and compete etc). While I think this would be a good use of the app, I think this knee-jerk reaction that an app like this *must* be an educational tool for children/young adults is problematic in that it highlights this idea that, as adults, one doesn't need to be actively reminded to read literature or--perhaps--to read literature at all. With that in mind, this could be good incentive to push the "visualization" aspect of our project even further--that is, to visually remind or inform the subject/reader of the cyclical/labour-centered mode of existence that they undergo on a day-to-day basis--something not unlike the notion of defamiliarization. At the same time, I think it is important to be critical of what kind of user we are assuming. That is, we risk solely focusing on a demographic of the population who are, for lack of better phrase, gainfully employed or in university. What of, for instance, a stay at home parent, (dis)abled peoples who cannot work, children/teenagers, or unemployed persons? We might risk, I think, assuming a degree of user privilege with our current model. 

Lots to think about for now. Our wireframes are in good shape, I think, so the next steps will be further developing our critical model and getting our video together. I'll have access to a fancy HD video from the lab I work at, so that shouldn't be too much of a problem. The video could be a really great way to get our critical framework across, so I think getting the screenplay in order will end up being a pretty involved process.
