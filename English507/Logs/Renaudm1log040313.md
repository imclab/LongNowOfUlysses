"Sea, wind, leaves, thunder, waters, cows lowing, the cattle market, cocks, hens don't crow, snakes hisses. There's music everywhere. Ruttledge's door: ee creaking. No, that's noise."
James Joyce Ulysses via Kahn's Noise, Water, Meat: A History of Sound in the Arts

## Dear Log

I've chosen to remain within the novel, or closely related ephemera such as Joyce speaking/reading or preferably historical recordings of songs referenced by Joyce in the novel. I am considering branching out a bit within the world of Joyce as there's a great recording of him reading Finnegans Wake.

Transcript:  
He began:
— Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment since by my learned friend. It seemed to me that I had been transported into a country far away from this country, into an age remote from this age, that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful Moses.
His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smoke ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech. And let our crooked smokes. Noble words coming. Look out. Could you try your hand at it yourself?
— And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride. I heard his words and their meaning was revealed to me.

From the Fathers

It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted. Ah, curse you! That's saint Augustine.
— Why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion and our language? You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen; we are a mighty people. You have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe. You have but emerged from primitive conditions: we have a literature, a priesthood, an agelong history and a polity.
Nile.
Child, man, effigy.
By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man supple in combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone.
— You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples, majestic and mysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon Ra. Yours serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas. Israel is weak and few are her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her arms. Vagrants and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at our name.
A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech. He lifted his voice above it boldly:
— But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day. He would never have spoken with the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai's mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of the outlaw.

## Max Stuff 
  
Looked at (http://playground.arduino.cc/interfacing/MaxMSP) I will keep it in mind as I may be helpful moving forward with instillation once the audio database is finished.

I stumbled upon (http://www.opusonemusic.net/muset/projects.html "UBC's MuSET Research Group"), which may prove handy for finding patches to fiddle with. I'm specifically looking at the (http://www.opusonemusic.net/muset/toolbox.html "toolbox")  

Note to self: build limiter into patch so volume doesn't get out of control also limit clips from being too quiet.

Note to self: Consider whether to have a reference page (cheat-sheet) in space for the files used and/or how the sound works.
