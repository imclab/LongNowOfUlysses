# HyperLit Log - 28 March 2013

## Shoot Day

Yesterday we shot the entire video. It was a long day, and I think we were successful in getting lots of great footage. We shot quite a few scenes, but since we had a fairly detailed plan as to what shots were needed (through the [storyboard](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/IterationTwo/HyperLitStoryboard.md)), we decided on locations and outlined a schedule for the day prior to shooting, and we had incredbily helpful volunteers, the entire shoot went smoothly.

Michael Stevens was the main character whose day we followed.

It was great to work with him, since he knows Joyce and *Ulysses* really well and was able to help us think of funny, satirical ways in which our main guy could interact with the Joyce Bot. The locations we selected for the shoot included Nina's apartment, the Maker Lab, a bathroom on campus, the Hillside Mall food court, a basketball court around Hillside, and the Beagle Pub. We had several extras who helped us shoot the basketball scene (thanks Arthur, Shaun, and Travis!):

One of the seemingly simple parts of the shoot that ended up being a bit tricky was to find ways to incorporate shots of the app wireframes within the video context. Not only was it difficult to determine which scenes would lend themselves to this most naturally, but we ended up also having a bit of a hard time getting visible and readable shots of the screens. As we edit the video we may need to incorporate actual screen casts for some of the scenes.

On a side note - one thing I did learn shooting this video: *Farmville* really is as stupid as it seems. It was the first time I even opened the game, and to me it seems like a very boring way to spend your time.

From an acting perspective, most of the scenes show Michael quite engaged and interacting with the Joyce Bot. I hadn't envisioned him interacting with the bot quite as much, but when Michael did not show strong reactions or pretend to communicate with the bot the scenes seemed boring and we were worried that it wouldn't be clear what was happening. It will be interesting to see how we can incorporate the Joyce Bot illustrations into the scenes when we edit the video.

Over the next few days we'll be editing the video. Selecting and piecing together the footage should not take too long, since we have a fairly detailed storyboard to work from. The challenge will be to incorporate the Joyce Bot. Right now, we're thinking that we'll simply place static illustrations of the bot into the video and add speech bubbles. We will also need to see how and if the Joycean commentary works once we incorporate it into the video narrative. We may need to solicit the helpful Joyce experts to come up with more commentary that is not just funny, but draws out the intended satire that will hopefully communicate the critique we are aiming for.

Jon here! Here are some more photos from the shoot yesterday. To echo Nina, it was a long day, but we got a ton of good footage. Everyone did a really great job, and we are super grateful to everyone who came out and helped out. Many thanks to Travis VanderVelden (for bringing us a basketball), Alex Christie (for providing the iPad), Shaun Macpherson (for basketball skills), Arthur Hains (for additional basketball skills), Adele Barclay (for acting in the board room scene), Jentery Sayers (for letting us film in the MakerLab) and Michael Stevens (for, of course, starring in this little piece).
