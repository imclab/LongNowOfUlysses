This log opens with a confession: I have been playing a really stupid iPhone game lately. The game is called "Jurrasic Park Builder." The game is just as it sounds: you have a slate of green jungle, some money, and options for building different structures, dinosaur cages, gardens etc. As the game progresses, you are required to simply click on dinosaurs, buildings,etc in order to collect  money earned to build and maintain your park. You must click each building within a specific time, though, else your buildings stop making money. The option to purchase more ingame money or coins to further expand your park with actual money is repeatedly recommended (you can purcahse 10 ingame dollars for $1.99, for instance). A highscore leaderboard reveals that users have either put SUBSTANTIAL amounts of time into the game, or significant amounts of actual money (around $100). There is, however, no way to be sure how they earned their highscore. 

Despite the fact that it is not that interesting of a game to look at or interact with, not that involving, and contains zero narrative, I find myself playing it. For some reason, this game of simply tapping on dinosaurs at select intervals has caught my attention (or lack thereof). Why? I really have no idea. This is, to be blunt, a stupid game. What I do know is that I my attention is most certainly being exploited--it's not hard to imagine someone considering this game as being an element of their day to day schedule (re: need to check the game every 20 minutes to collect money). 

As I understand it, this is essentially a FarmVille clone. I have never played FarmVille, but I think I get the gist of it. What I find interesting is that this game that hinges upon simply seeing subtle changes in your park actually motivates people to play for subtantial abounts of time, or pay money. 

This game is, of course, everything that our HyerLit project rallies against and critiques. This program is clearly exploiting minutes out of my day for no real reason, and has created, in a sense, a digital economy out of my simply tapping little diunosaurs on the screen. And this game, of course, is exactly what Ian Bogost is critiquing with his game CowClicker. So while I can never get those bits of my life back where I have played this game, I think something useful in regards to our app could come out of this. 

Specifically, I am toying with  the idea of incorporating an element into our HyperLit project that forces the user to be aware of how apps like FarmVille or Jurassic Park Builder or social media sites more generally problmatically draw on and exploit this notion of our attention as a kind of commodity, and how users are willing to throw three dollars here or there towareds a silly game in order to gain simple stylistic upgrades to a fictional dinosaur park that no one else will ever see or care about. In short, a critique of casual mobile gaming and gamification. What if, I wonder, we could incoporate this into our HyperLit app? That is, to make available an option where a user can, instead of reading the segment, simply purchase the illusion of having read a chapter (and thus get the badge). However, I think it would be crucial for HyperLit to make it explicitly clear that a user has PURCHASED a badge, segment, or chapter, and to make clear how much money a user might spend on segments/badges in total,  thus making it very clear who put their "deep attention" to work, and who simply copped out and bought the badge, achievement. etc. To really push the critique element of this, I think it would be crucial for the game to, well, admonish a user for simply purchasing a badge or segment, and for unique deprecating badges to be awarded to users who simply plug money into the system to earn a bunch of flashy awards opposed to reading. 

We have, I think, been struggling to incorporate the critical element of our project into the wireframes, layout etc. This might be a way, I think, to show this problem, and to make users aware that so many apps, games, etc encourage or offer this option to purchase progress opposed to earning it. I should hope that the critique will make sense, too, in that it is not simply a fictitious farm that one has the option of making in HyperLit, but the experience of having read Ulysses (a experience which, I sincerely hope, is of more cultural value than a pixely dinosaur park). Likely more to come, here. In the meantime, check out this game made by Ian Bogost called Simony which does, I think, explore some of these ideas: [http://www.bogost.com/games/simony.shtml]
