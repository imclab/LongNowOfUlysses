##A Brief History of our Joyce Bot 

Given that the Joyce Bot is a crucial (albeit late) addition to our project, I thought it would be good to give a brief little history or workflow of how we've incorporated him into our project. I was trying to have this uploaded to Github for class today, but my GitHub client was acting up--it turns out that it was indeed an EEE specific problem (an error in my Github shell or something). 

As mentioned in the log that brought you here, we briefly talked about the Joyce Bot way back in February. I had to dig through some emails to find the original wireframe (from February 8th). To be sure, this "bot" was pretty different than what it is now--essentially a picture of Joyce that would give helpful tips on how to navigate the site etc. It was scrapped pretty quickly (by both of us), but it's interesting, I think, that the idea was considered so early in the process. Here's the wireframe:

A pretty clunky and distant relative to what we have now, but worth noting, I think, that it was an early idea. The idea, in part, was inspired by the monkey avatar that I had noticed in the "Mail Chimp" program my partner was using at the time (http://mailchimp.com/). Again, pretty simplistic, but shows that a vague notion of AI was kicking around in our minds at the beginning. 

Fast forward a few months and the Joyce Bot is an integral part of our project. As we've noted, the Joyce Bot is a really great way to bring out the satirical and critical elements of the project that, we felt, was missing in our wireframes. It's too bad that we didn't have the idea ready in time for Games Without Frontiers--I think we would have received a different reaction from viewers. 

My girlfriend offered to help out with some more illustrations, which is fantastic. I scanned the images this morning, and started plunking them into the wire frames. Pardon the giant images! Here they are:

Incorporating the images into the wireframes was a bit tricky. I didn't want to have a white box around the Joyce figure (this would cut into images in the wireframes), so I had to modify them as photoshop files to allow for blank space (blank space cant exist with jpegs: blank=white). Unfortunately, Balsamiq doesn't support psb files! So, I ended up exporting the wireframes as pngs and importing them into photoshop, then past the psb Joyce overtop. In retrospect, pretty simple, but it was a bit of a headache at the time. I'm pretty pleased with the final product. Using text in photoshop is a horrible chore, so the text bubbles were a bit finicky, but nothing too crazy. I'm a little wary at how we are at incorporate these images into the video... I *think* final cut pro supports psbs, but I'm not 100% sure. Regardless, the animating might be a whole different process, so that all remains to be seen. 

The final Joyce Bot frames can, of course, be found here: (https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/IterationTwo/HyperLitWireframesBot.md)
