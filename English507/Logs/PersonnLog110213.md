##Development of a Data Model
I use the [Spreadsheet Mapper 3.1.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?pli=1&key=0AmRwQGTwte_UdHh0anlRVENUTXJ2NWFGOWd2SENYUGc&newcopy) for communication between my data and Google Earth/Maps, which I learned in the following tutorial: [Spreadsheet Mapper](http://www.google.com/earth/outreach/tutorials/spreadsheet3.html) 

Google Earth/Maps lets you choose between different designs for their "balloons," which are each able to display different information for placemarks. The template that provides options for including both Image and Text (template #3) seems to best fit my needs for this project, as I will mostly be dealing with information on people and images that display a likeness of the person (photograph or painting) and/or their contribution to the network (postcards, letters, etc.). It is probably a good idea, for reasons of recognizability, to customize the look of the "balloons" by changing the template's KLM Style Variables (in line with the color schema of a famous *Ulysses* cover, e.g. Carin Goldberg's design for the 1986 Gabler Edition), but this will be a future stylistic decision that has to correspond to Google Map's color schema. Finally, I decided to assign each network (Zurich, Trieste, Paris) a layer in Google Earth/Maps. Due to the infrastructure of Spreadsheet Mapper as mapping one layer per folder, I will likely be dealing with at least three different folders in one sheet. The final number of layers/folders depends on a decision between two options of thinking about what constitutes a node in these networks (a city? the author? a respondent?):

#Option A: 
Joyce is the center of the network(s) and, as such, a placemark on every layer/sheet.  The theoretical question that follows is this: if I want to de-center the author figure in the networks that brought about *Ulysses*, then how do I avoid reinstating the authorial centrality by making Joyce the *centre* of the networks? This line of inquiry led to the following possibility:  

#Option B: 
Joyce, the author, is a fourth node/layer. But this also presents a question: what is the element that connects the members of the network if the author is suppressed? How do I avoid presenting them as a loose collection of unconnected sources? And, does the difficulty of thinking a novelistic network *without the novelist* point to the continuing prevalence of the author in our thinking about how a work evolves? This last point, in fact, convinces me that making the author a visual option that can be "turned on or off" (i.e. a layer) allows the viewer potential insights into how we, i.e. readers, academics, etc., construct novelistic work. This self-reflexivity, which might lay bare some seemingly unconscious assumptions, now appears to be an *advantage* (at least in theory). Subsequently, the challenge is to translate this theoretical possibility of Option B into an actually edifying visualization. (It might be a good idea to visually highlight connections between Joyce and his respondents via an image overlay, while not tracing any visual connections when the author-node/layer is "turned off." But can there be image overlay between two different layers/sheets?     

With respect to the integration of time as another dimension into the visualization of the networks, Google Earth's *Timeslide* function seems to be of interest: it allows you to map the transformations (in one network? from one network to another?) over time, both forwards and backwards. Every placemark will therefore have a [Time Stamp](https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#timestamp) in the advanced options section of my my data set in order to keep open the possibility of animating the "growth" of the network (e.g. "glacier"-like with image overlays?) What I am unsure of is whether this line of thinking about how to animate time answers to Walter Benjamin's critique of "homogeneous" temporal representations.  

Problem with the model as of Feb. 11, 2013: the images do not load from the specified urls in Google Maps (in Google Earth, it works fine, but here image size and resolution are still an issue).
