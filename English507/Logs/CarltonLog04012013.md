I really quickly edited my homepage to list the edition used for our text extracts. Although this detail is included in my XML, I thought it might be useful to mention it in a place more easily accesible to the general public (not everyone wants to sift through source code). 

The final (for this semester) iteration of my project can be found, as always, in my repo, and here: http://web.uvic.ca/~dcarlton/extracts/complete/longernowsite/
