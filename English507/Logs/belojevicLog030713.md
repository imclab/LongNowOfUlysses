# Nina's Log - 7 March, 2013

Our main focus over the last few weeks has been on wireframe development, user flow, and creation of design elements for the HyperLit app. Although the wireframes are coming along well, I'm finding it increasingly difficult to determine in what ways we can transparently communicate the critical framework of the *HyperLit* concept through the wireframes and app design. 

Based on the original theoretical infuencers and conceptual framework, the idea behing *HyperLit* can best be described as a form of satire. It's indended to satirize several areas of current social, economic, and institutional structures and approaches, particularly what Jonathan Beller calls the "attention economy," the academy, the Web 2.0, and gamification. With Beller's concept of the "attention economy" and the value production of leisure time in mind, the app offers a critique of the current socioeconomic structure and the individual's cyclical habits that feed into it. By plugging directly into the user's calendar, inserting "reading time" in it, and visualizing the user's day in a satirical style, *HyperLit* aims to create awareness among users in a critical, but fun way. The app fills free time with "reading time," a form of entertainment that is becoming less and less common (at least when it comes to reading classics and high literature) and that is unproductive in the economic sense of labour production. In this way, it resists productive leisure time and merges play/work or entertainment/learning in a way that can be seen as containing labour, but a form of labour that does not have economic value.

The binaries play/work and entertainment/learning bring up two other areas of critique that the app aims to communicate. Firstly, the concept of gamification. A common critique of video games in the digital economy is that play and labour often blend together, creating an environment of unpaid labour. This comes out even more strongly in gamification, which Ian Bogost sees as "exploitationware." Gamification is used to encourage certain forms of behaviour and engagement. However, *HyperLit* encourages engagement with an activity that has no value economically, which brings me to the second area in which these binaries are relevant: the academy. Satirizing individuals' habits in the attention economy by suggesting that reading and anlyzing literature offer no production value, the app also satirizes activities in the academy. If reading, analyzing, and writing have no value, then what does the work of scholars do? While there are, of course, lots of obvious responses that will nix this question, it draws attention to the siloed, privlileged, and self-sustaining structure that much of the academy is based on. In addition to this suggestion, *HyperLit* also opens up the space of studying and engaging with literature. The open structure of the app makes literary studies accessible to everyone, allowing for collaborative annotations and innovative forms of peer-to-peer review. The play/work or entertainment/learning binaries also call attention to the learning environment of traditional institutions in contrast to open-access environments and the quantified self culture. Furthermore, keeping the hyper and deep attention split in mind, the app shows that an environment that does not privlige either mode of attention may make literary studies the most accessible to the largest number of people.

Finally, *HyperLit* could satirize aspects of the Web 2.0 by using the framework of that environment to engage users in common activities (socializing, commenting, browsing, reading, etc.) but with a focus on reading a completely different type of content. Leveraging the focus on socialbility, immediacy, and attention that the Web 2.0 offers, *HyperLit* uses behaviour that is familiar to encourage critical thinking and deep engagement with culture and history rather than mere consumption of content.

*HyperLit* to some extent inhabits or relies on all of these spaces (the attention economy, the academy, Web 2.0, and gamification), but criticizes what it uses. I think that the most effective way of communicating this would be to use a satirical approach (in the comics, the language, etc.), but we'll need to still explore ways to implement such an approach consistently, while still designing an app that would be usable and effective.
