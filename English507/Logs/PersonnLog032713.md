## Reflections After Iteration Two

The last workshop in the term helped me gain clarity about how to resolve some open design questions and about what final details still need to be taken care of. At this point, i.e. at the time of the second iteration and workshop, I have added a fourth network to the already existing three in order to include those constant contributors, such as Joyce's aunt Josephine Murray, who were his "research assistants" in Dublin during the entire period of the composition of the novel—a period in which Joyce barely ever set foot back on Irish soil and thus relied heavily on people doing research for him in his hometown:

By manually assigning each contributor a hexadecimal code, I have completed color coding the existent actors in the network, which list is displayed under the Map View or Timeline, respectively:

This still leaves open the question of how to represent Joyce in this network of contributors/actors. The discussion during the workshop encouraged me to simply, but maybe radically, omit the author in this *co-author* network altogether. This is partly due to practical considerations. After all, Joyce is on record to have told John Quinn that his Parisienne flat at 9 rue de L'Université was "the twentieth address" at which he had written *Ulysses*. Apart from the fact that a network involving so many placemarks might be quite confusing, it is doubtful that it has any explanatory value with respect to an understanding of the network that enabled the composition of the novel. In some ways, then, this seemingly "radical" decision is in line with the main theoretical impetus of my project: to decenter the author figure and, consequently, to highlight the network of contributors. By leaving out the author node, I hope to now have achieved this in the most logically consistent way. 
Finally, there are a few things I still need to do before the roundtable presentation of *Networked Ulysses*:

* The workshop discussion encouraged me to improve on the List View—so far the least visually appealing view of the three—by including little thumbnail images of the contributors. This will provide a visual and biographical dimension that is not a part of the temporal and spatial representations of the network enabled by the other two views, thus giving a reason for why to feature this view in the first place.
* I will need to finish adding contributors to the Dublin network (e.g. Joyce's brother Stanislaus, who will presumably also end up being a member of the Trieste network, given the fact that he lived with the Joyce family during the first part of their stay in Italy). This network includes only one member so far and should be roughly of the same size as the other networks in order to avoid the impression that it could somehow be less important than the networks mapping Joyce's contributors in Trieste, Paris, and Zürich.  
* Finally, I will need to find a catchy subtitle for my project that succinctly conveys both the impetus behind *Networked Ulysses* and the idea that a project like this is necessarily open-ended. Especially the latter point is significant in order to avoid simply replacing the author James Joyce with a dispersed network of authorship that could, however, still fill the traditional role of textual authority. By leaving the network open, I hope to convey that any notion of closure would reinstate the Author here.
