Meeting with Nina--Monday, February 4

##If We Actually Built This Thing... 
* Primarily hosted as a website, with mobile optimization, integrated with Google Calendar... 
* Integrated w/Google Calendar via a Google Plugin that relies on javascript within the google app.... then integrated to our website through API... 
* Data would need to be stored in a database: would need to figure out what is being stored, how it's visualized etc. 
* Question: how are they storing the digitized *Ulysses* that we would be working with? Looks like text via the MVP
* How would reading be tracked? Input manually? Could be as simple as pushing a button (read x section at xyz time). 
* Annotate as you read function? 
* Sidebar of sorts? Way play to plunk in annotations/notes, see others etc. See where others made comments. 
* Start simple: going to work under the assumption that people will be reading this on the computer. People don't *love* reading on a computer. How can we take better advantage of the computer as a interactive device to supplement literature? 
* click complete... create comment on what you've read? gives you a token/achievement of sorts that you can share. If you have questions about the text, those can be answered by others who have read it etc; a feedback column, a discussion forum. 
* 
##Visualizing the Thing
* would need to create a profile that links to your google.....
* API *should* be able to link
* Display your day in web comic: provide a storyboard for day? Way in which your day would be literarized.... stock images for certain categories... your daily activities could be displayed in a really mundane way, while those moments of deep attention would be aesthetically unique, attractive, and striking. A sharing functionality? Visualization of your calendar.... unique content for each chapter/book etc that *should* be read. 
* If, ideally, things sycn both ways, should be able to get a prompt to remind reader to read at alotted times. 
* hyperlinks/links of interest in side bar (along with annotations/notes from other readers). 
* Once you've gotten through section: Congratulations, segment completed... Badge awarded... prompt box opens for comments etc. Sharing function, of course, for facebook twitter etc; make it public. 
* How are points to be allocated?: points contribute towards your "reader" level: pro reader (has read 20  books), ulysses gives you x amount of points opposed to the old man and the sea might give you less points etc. Points for annotations? Points for feedback? 
* Challenges introduced by the site itself: it's holiday reading blast! See how many books you can read during the month of December etc. List all of the winners etc. 

#To Do:

* Look into more examples of reading/health apps (Kobo, Kindle, etc; play with them), what they might be missing, what specific elements could be built on etc. 

* Work on mockups this week, next week begin on storyboard for video. 

#Thoughts and Responses to Needs Assessment Feedback
"Comparable to the thought piece, parts of the description might be too ambitious for what you can achieve, especially when using Balsamiq. That said, how could you express some of the design features and specs through video? Or, to put it differently: what could video do that Balsamiq cannot? (I hope the example vid prototypes I circulated will help here. Let me know if you need more resources.)"

* Right; part of what we have been trying to do is formulating what the *ideal* app would look like. Our video will place more emphasis on how the app would effect the user's day-to-day habits, and how the app would alter one's everydayness (i.e.: user is working on the computer, receives a notice via google calendar/app that it's time to read for 20 minutes, reads for 20 minutes, leaves feedback etc). 

"If you want audio in your video prototype, then you can also include headphones in the exhibit. Your choice. (I can see the benefits of a silent prototype, tho, especially in a moment when silent film is having a renaissance. The talkies weren't a thing in 1904, either.)"

* Yes; audio in the film will probably be pretty superficial--some music etc. Any important information could be relayed via text and through images, much like some of the Balsamiq videos we have seen. 

"Soon, I'll be asking for a data model for each project. In your case, that can be a wireframe based in a Balsamiq prototype, together with some key features of your app. In other words: your data model will be a design model. However, you are also welcome to identify how your app will or would tap into the Google Calendar API, which is another way to structure data"

* This will be the primary focus for the next week or so--getting some wireframes going etc. 

"Mind explaining how InDesign would figure in? Or let me know what you're considering web-wise. I'm happy to help"

* For now we'll stick to Balsamiq, but we imagine that at a later point of development we'll need to start thinking about what kind of web design tools we'll be using. We'll let you know! 

"As for your DHSI plans, I could contact Andy and Matt, if you want. Give them a heads up, and help you plan accordingly? Let me know if this option appeals."

* As this project develops, it could be a great idea to let them know! Neither of us really know what the workshop might ultimately look like, but if they could be made aware of what we are doing/interested in, it would be great if they could function in some mentoring copacity, however briefly (providing necessary reading, helpful tools for development etc). 

That's it for now! More to come.
