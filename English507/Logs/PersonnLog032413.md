##Moving Forward with Exhibit: Implementation of Map View and Timeline View

I have been able to finally remove a major stumbling block in the development of my Exhibit page of Networked Ulysses: the activation of Exhibit extensions such as Map View and Timeline. It is most likely that my HTML code was invalid, i.e. that there might have been too many div-containers, so that the browser was unable to display the desired Exhibit Views. I took care of this problem by cleaning up the code step-by-step, bracketing Views one after another, thus checking for flaws in my code in a more meticulous manner. Another potential mistake in my earlier piece of code was that I referred to the RC (Release Candidate) version of Exhibit 3.0. I have now updated these references to the Exhibit script, now linking to [the most recent script](http://api.simile-widgets.org/exhibit/3.0.0). This might also have helped in fixing the display of extensions. (This whole process was particularly laborious since most of the documentation for Exhibit 3.0 has not been fully developed yet; the available documentation largely refers to version 2.2.0, an earlier version of Exhibit.) 
Now that the extensions were activated, I started to build the exhibit according to my sketch of how I wanted the whole page to look:

Since I had already built the "People" View, I now implemented the Map View. In my spreadsheet, I had already prepared this function earlier by including geospatial data (latitude and longitude). Now I simply had to allow the browser to grab these data and use it to locate the placemarks. Since it had become apparent during the first iteration that it would be preferable to be able to color code these placemarks (after all, there would be more than one placemark for some contributors, and I wanted to be able to visualize that I was referring to the same person, yet located in different places). Exhibit requires you to manually define a different color for each person (this happens globally, i.e. for all Views, which means that I will only have to define these colors once, and all other extensions, such as Timeline, will be able to use the same color definition for each person). Exhibit requires a definition of the color in hexadecimal notation, which specifies a combination of red, green, and blue color values (RGB). After assigning some of these colors, the browser displayed the following Map View:

Then I specified the lens for this View such that the following would be displayed by clicking on a placemark icon: the place (underlined), the name of the person, and a longer description of the person's contribution to the making of *Ulysses*:

Now that the Map View was working, I moved to implement the Timeline View. Since I had already fixed the HMTL for the implementation of the Map View, there was initially no problem with assigning the right script for this extension. Again, I had already prepared the necessary start and end dates for the period in which a particular person contributed to Joyce's novel in my spreadsheet. Therefore, the extension could simply grab these dates and plot them on a timeline. However, since I initially designed my data model with a map visualization in mind, I had assigned the label tag, which is necessary in Exhibit, the *places* where Joyce's contributors were located. The Timeline extensions automatically uses this label category and plots it in time; but since it does not make sense for my network to have a visualization of *places* in time—and not, as originally intended, of *contributors*—I had to make a few changes to my spreadsheet: I renamed the category originally called "person" as "label;" the original "label" category now became "place." Based on these modifications, the resulting Timeline View looked like this (there are, as in the case of Map View, just a few entries so far; but this is simply due to the need for further research of historical dates and will be added before the Exhibit is completed):

The last step in realizing my initial sketch was to enable a View panel at the top of the page, which allows a user to switch back and forth between spatial (Map), temporal (Timeline), and straight-forwardly linear (Tiles) representations of the network. After moving the boxes for sorting the network by different parameters to the right side of the screen and using a [css stylesheet](http://www.blueprintcss.org/blueprint/screen.css) as a model for making fonts and visuals in the Exhibit look better, I arrived at the following design, which corresponds to my initial design sketch and will therefore serve as the model for my final Exhibit:
