##Reflections After Feedback from Iteration One

The workshop helped me resolve or think more deeply about the following open questions with respect to my mapping project:

* what to do with data that does not quite "fit" my three-network approach.

My two respondents encouraged me to map out a Dublin network, analogous to the three networks I already set up, in order to include those respondents not covered by the existing layers. I have come to see this as the easiest way of resolving this issue, even though it slightly undermines the neat connection between the infrastructure of my project and the last entry in Joyce's novel. 

* whether the networks need to cohere visually.

My respondents agreed that there is a downside to making the networks cohere visually, because such an image overlay, for instance in the form of a line or path between different locations, could be construed as prefiguring the way in which viewers of the map make connections. Hence I have decided to refrain from any visual way of making the networks cohere; rather, I will let viewers explore the networks and their entries on their own, guided only by the option to turn layers on and off. After all, these categories already group the locations/correspondents of a network together under a unifying header.       

* how to display the project in the exhibit space.

In the discussion with my respondents, two options emerged. One involves sharing an actual computer or a touchscreen with other map projects in the exhibit space. This approach would transport the interactive quality of these mapping projects into the exhibit space itself. The problem with it, however, is that there is a considerable threat of theft of these expensive items, in particular since the exhibit is an open space that will not be monitored constantly. The other option involves a collage of printouts of the individual networks and cut-outs of the info boxes that will be glued onto the printed maps. A model for how to mount such a collage are the maps of murders in crime shows, which feature "tacks" to mark crime scenes. A challenge for this approach will be to find the right scale for the maps, so that the glued-on info boxes will not block other important parts of the map. So, with these considerations in mind, I am now leaning towards *two materializations* of the map: one as a web-based virtual map, and one as a physical collage in the exhibit. 

My conversations with the respondents have also helped me gain clarity about the strengths of my map as a resource or teaching tool. Furthermore, I have received an interesting idea about how to map those contributors, as well as Joyce himself, who moved around a lot during the years 1914-1922, and thus cannot be confined to a single location on the map. A way to convey visually that this is the same person in different places would be to color-code the respective placemarks, e.g. all James Joyce addresses would be red, all Stanislaus Joyce addresses would be blue, etc. Coming to think of it, a color scheme like this might be a good way of highlighting different networks visually, too. Finally, the group discussion about the difference between Google Maps and Google Earth, two possible "venues" for launching my map, has reinforced my belief that Google Maps better suits my purposes: it provides less information but looks cleaner, has a better interface, and it does not emphasize features like a region's topography, which are not necessary for my visualization of the *Ulysses* networks.
