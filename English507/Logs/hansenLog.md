(I don't use a client, so this could get weird, what with all the cutting and pasting...)

##11 February

I deleted a template and could not get it back when I was playing around with my data model, so I have copied and pasted info into a new spreadsheet. I have learned my lesson: just don't delete things. 

[My new data model.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ap8FIppSqxLDdFJZakxSM3ROZzMxU25FNjZuelktU1E&usp=sharing)

Will continue sourcing material for map. I happened upon a [SUNY Buffalo exhibit](http://library.buffalo.edu/pl/exhibits/joycebloomsday/caseXII/index.html) that chronicles some of the translations of *Ulysses* -- it seems a good place to start (will give me the chance to accumulate some easily accessible data before moving on to film adaptations and theatrical productions). 


##9 February

Have the data model link via prompt (not email -- thanks, JS!). 

Even though I am not there yet, data-wise, I decided to see if I have Google Earth on my laptop. Yes, it turns out, I do. Date modified? 28-Jan-09 -- it's been a while. Opened GE and everything is working well (which is a relief, given my aged laptop's inability to cope with most programs). 

I have managed to create modify a template, create some sample data, and visualize sample KML file in GE. 



###Some Issues

1. There is something strange going on with my template sheet and GE: my data is not showing -- just the title. 
2. I retrieved latlong from GE by locating address info I have from a source -- once KML transfers back to GE, the point are not where they should be (DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany in the middle of the English Strait?). 

Will continue to work with data model to figure out quirks -- so far, it looks promising. 


##5 February

JS has suggested both a data model for using Google Earth, and also a means of creating an animation of the map: screen shots edited into a short film. Simple, right? Sounds perfect to me -- iMovie and the like I know well enough to make that happen. 

The data model for Google Earth looks really approachable, which is a relief. I am excited to get some of my sample data into the spreadsheet -- will do once JS provides link to the model. 


##4 February

JS has strongly advised against using Flash -- I will defer to his judgment (apparently Google Earth can do something equally cool with less difficulty on my part). We will discuss it more in class tomorrow, so I will hopefully have a more concrete plan, and be able to move into data collection as per my Needs Assessment timeline.

In the comments on the NA, JS also questioned my workflow for the project -- I will figure that out once I know my program and how to proceed (next week?).

In response to my Thought Piece, JS suggested that Neatline might not be the best option because of its academic aesthetic and operability. Therefore, I am thinking that I might attempt to create an animated map using Flash. I have never used Flash before, but my former Grade 8 students could do it rather effortlessly (and not the tech-savvy kids, either), so I should be able to figure it out...

Right now, I envision a short animation that populates a world map with different iterations (translations, film adaptations, etc.) of Ulysses. The points will be annotated with info about the iterations, effectively showing the spatial and temporal influence of Ulysses across the globe.

Unfortunately, I think olfactory is out because of the campus's no-scent policy -- that raises the question of bureaucratic influence on artistic expression. Also, this makes me question the space itself: what exactly will we be able to accomplish in this space if sound and scent are limited? Will we be able to create an intelligent environment? Is an alcove in a quiet study area the ideal venue for an exhibit on the continuing influence of modernism, which by definition celebrated disruption?

I admit that I am beginning to feel the possibility of disappointment regarding what we will be able to do. My fear is that digital elements -- my map, for example -- will be relegated to an "online component," thereby perpetuating the divide between the digital and the analogue. Sad. Face.  


##22 January

I love the idea of the relational in an exhibit -- like reader response in a museum/gallery environment. This is why I am still eager to incorporate smell into the exhibit. Apparently, the sense which connects most closely with memory and emotion is smell (and Joyce was into all of the senses). This isn't new -- see John Harris's 1979 essay ["Oral and Olfactory Art"](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3331746?uid=3739400&uid=2129&uid=2&uid=70&uid=3737720&uid=4&sid=21101797393497) -- but it is also avant-garde in the art scene -- see New York's [Museum of Art and Design](http://www.madmuseum.org/events/design-and-structure-olfactory-art-1). 


##21 January

I've made my first major change -- and it's groundbreaking: I'm using Firefox. Although I have staunchly opposed Firefox in the past (until last week) because of it's PC-aesthetic, I am trying to get used to it. 

Also, I am playing around with ideas for my project, which I know I want to involve mapping. Right now, I am thinking Neatline, even though I am not familiar with the program, nor is my laptop able to run it. Given the busyness of the Maker Lab these days, Neatline might not be a wise choice because of limited access to adequate infrastructure. I will investigate further after the Thought Piece presentations and before working on my Needs Assessment.
