Some internet-hunting has turned up some new sources of Ulysses-related sounds


This [ridiculously designed german site](http://members.aon.at/andreas.weigel/James-Joyce-Vertonungen.htm) has a large amount of pop culture music that references Ulysses

And this [JJ fan site](http://www.themodernword.com/joyce/music/chamber_music.html) has a great listing of classical and jazz music to the same effect

Of course, I found these only a few days ago, which means last-minute data model changes to incorporate the new finds.
