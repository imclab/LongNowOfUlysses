##Rationale for Change of Technology 

The discussions with other seminar members highlighted the necessity to color-code my networks (as well as certain constant contributors such as Joyce's brother Stanislaus). This led me to consider switching to a tool called [Exhibit 3](http://www.simile-widgets.org/exhibit), a technology built by people at MIT that allows the presentation of data in numerous forms, e.g. in a map and/or with a timeline function. An example of how Exhibit can be used to map the connections in a piece of literature is [Mapping John Glassco's Memoirs of Montparnasse](http://aelang.net/projects/glassco.htm). This example shows that, in contrast to Google Maps, Exhibit provides more and other functions which could make navigating my networks more interactive and more interesting for users. These considerations regarding presentation and interactiveness have caused me to shift technologies halfway through the project. Fortunately, as [this tutorial](http://simile-widgets.org/wiki/How_to_make_an_exhibit_from_data_fed_directly_from_a_Google_Spreadsheet) demonstrates, Exhibit can be fed data directly from a Google spreadsheet. After a few attempts at linking the data directly into an HTML page from my already written spreadsheet, I realized that I needed to define the spreadsheet such that Exhibit can recognize the data according to its own parameters. An example for a paradigm of such an "Exhibit-ready" spreadsheet can be found on the Glassco exhibit or [provided by the Exhibit programmers](https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pLvsUS-CftHo21r-0xjKvVA). After creating a new spreadsheet with the required parameters, Exhibit required me to copy the address of the RSS feed that is linked to the spreadsheet, so that it can update the data directly from the sheet. Once I pasted this feed address into the HTML code of the website I'm building, I arrived at the following bare-bones version of (a part of) my data:

The next steps will be to copy the rest of my data from the Spreadsheet mapper to the newly-created spreadsheet specially defined for Exhibit, and to learn how to activate the Map View and Timeline functions that are add-ons for Exhibit and which I will need to learn in order to materialize my data in the desired way. Afterwards, I will attempt to tweak the color values of certain placemarks.
