## Re: Manovitch and [Cultural Analytics](http://www.manovich.net/cultural_analytics.pdf)  

I'm not sure I understand the obsession with size and scale (big data, big screens) nor the apparent imperative on the visual here. Cultures are expressed in a variety of forms; is Manovitch's insistence on strictly visual expressions of culture hegemonic in some way?   

What is potentially lost in "thinking of culture as data... that can be mined and visualized"? The expression "mining" for me suggests a kind of expropriation, and begs the question of purpose or intent: who will use this cultural "data" and to what kinds of use? This gets a little scary when he talks about "possible commercial applications": "Cultural Analytics should be of interest to providers of media metrics, trend forecasters, social media companies and, in principle, *all big media companies and publishers*."     

I do, however, like the gesture of situating the project of Cultural Analytics into a history of technologies not only influencing cultures, but creating new disciplines and modes of cultural analysis (from slides to art history; from projectors to film studies). 

# Data Model

12 February, 2013

For my data model I've decided to do a simple [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ald25Z0nufmWdHUyVUdYVWIzY2VWZUJpdklrT1dFRWc#gid=0) to keep track of metadata like file name, type, format, date, and the stereoscope component. 
Initially, my data will just be several images of each stereoscope component, which I'll keep in an open directory (dropbox? Drive?) arranged by component type; after that I'm going to start sticthing the images of each component into 3D models that can be printed and then assembled.
It's kind of a strange process, because production here actually precedes most of the modelling; in this way, it's like reverse modelling -- like the the exact opposite of modelling in, say, architectural projects (where it would be absurd to build a building and *then* make a scale model).
But at the same time, I'm working from a kit where the components are cut from templates, so there are physical models out there prior to production, prior to assemblage; there's also the fact that the kit is a replica of an unpatented nineteenth-century technology, itself an improved version of earlier stereoscopes, so it's difficult to pin down any sort of originary model.
It's been interesting to start to think generally about models, and about processes of production and reproduction in both digital and non-digital (industrial) environments.
