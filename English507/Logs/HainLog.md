## Modeling and Making

25 March, 2013

I spent this past Friday at the Maker Lab photographing the stereoscope components for 3D modeling purposes. Since some of these -- namely the card slide and the lens board -- come in the kit preassembled, I first had to take some things apart. Then I set up a stool with some newspaper for contrast and a green screen, a video camera for documentation, and started to take pictures -- about 20 side-angle shots and up to 20 high-angle shots, plus close-ups of any unusual details -- of each stereoscope component.

Because of the sheer amount of photographs -- 7 components with up to 40 shots per component -- my data model had to be revised. Entering simple metadata like file name, type, date, and component name for each of these shots when so much of this information is common between items (i.e. they're all JPEGs, all composed on March 22) seemed daunting and senseless. On my workstation, I have the data organized in folders by component name, and my [new data model](https://drive.google.com/?tab=mo&authuser=0#folders/0B1d25Z0nufmWdjRMdFJucnJDRU0) is actually just screen shots of the contents of each of these folders (this just as effectively conveys metadata like file name, type *etc.* and saves a lot of unnecessary data entry). 

Having compiled the photographs necessary to 3D model each component, I spent the weekend staining and assembling the stereoscope. [Here's](http://img850.imageshack.us/img850/476/screenshot20130325at354.png) me cutting up a t-shirt, and [here's](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1d25Z0nufmWUnFXRlBSVmg2MGM/edit?usp=sharing) some footage of me applying a first coat to some surfaces. Important, if obvious tip: make sure to do this kind of thing in a properly ventilated space.

I put on three coats, which ended up being more like 5 applications, because only a few surfaces are accesible at a time, and because you have to wait for a surface to dry before flipping it. Here is a shot of the freshly stained components:

I let it all dry overnight and assembled the stereoscope Sunday morning. [Here's](http://img21.imageshack.us/img21/5379/screenshot20130325at356.png) a close-up of the lenses and lens board pre-assembly, and [here's](http://img138.imageshack.us/img138/5379/screenshot20130325at356.png) me screwing in the pedestal to the nearly-completed stereoscope. Finally, there's this:

Today was considerably more high-tech and consisted of capturing/ stitching together a 3D model for my first stereoscope component.

And here are some shots of the cropped and exported 3D model:

## A day in UVic Special Collections  

13 March, 2013  

I was just in UVic Special Collections browsing through the physical archive of the [Gis√®le Freund fonds](http://library.uvic.ca/spcoll/findaids/1997-039.pdf) and talking to Christopher Petter about permission to use some of the photographs in the Long Now Exhibit. It's a huge, and very cool collection, and contains not only some of the most famous photographs of Joyce (like the one where he stands in front of a taxi, for example), but also photographs of Auden, Colette, the Woolfs, Forster, Sartre, Beckett, Henry Miller, Matisse -- really everyone. Aside from portraits, some highlights include Joyce's [marked up proofs of Finnegans Wake](http://contentdm.library.uvic.ca/cdm/singleitem/collection/collection10/id/351/rec/14) and Simone de Beauvoir's hand-written introduction to Freund's book.  

Anyways, I now have high-res un-watermarked scans of the collection's contents for exhibit use only (I won't be able to include them in any online component of the exhibit). From here I can start to mess around with some selections in Photoshop, offsetting position, maybe colour-tinting, so that they can be viewed in 3D via the Holmes stereoscope. I will also continue to look for photographs from other sources for inclusion in the exhibit as well.  

## Some reflections following first draft workshops  

5 March, 2013  

The consensus seems to be that [my anxieties over using anachronistic photographs](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/IterationOne/HainIterationOne.md) are to some degree unnecessary, or at least overblown. While Tim definitely stresses the strength of this project's empathetic gesture in attempting to approximate Bloomian modes of vision, or phenomenologies of modernity, he also suggests that it's not entirely necessary to only use historically and geographically specific photographs (of Dublin, 1904) to render this experience. He points out Joyce's fascination with the etymology of the name Odysseus: both every-man (or was it no-man?) and God (from Zeus). So while it would be great to have historically and geographically appropriate material for exhibit-goers to view stereoscopically, other sources ([Edward Quinn](http://www.amazon.ca/James-Joyces-Dublin-Edward-Quinn/dp/0436395002), for example) might also fit in with the "Long Now" theme and point to the fact that -- as Tim suggests -- there are Blooms after Bloom, even contemporary Blooms.   

Mitch prefers Quinn's photographs of landmarks in *Ulysses* to some of the material in [the Freund collection](http://contentdm.library.uvic.ca/cdm/search/collection/collection10) and suggests thinking not just about what kinds of photographs are going to be most appropriate (historically and geographically) to the narrative of *Ulysses*, but also what photographs are going to be most interesting for exhibit-goers to experience in 3D. I definitely agree that it's important to think about the experiential aspect of the exhibit, and find myself having a lot of affinities with Mitch's aesthetic approach to exhibit-building as not merely expository, but also as an artistic practice.  

Jentery has also offered some valuable feedback regarding stereoscope content, suggesting I look into the English 560 asset list of reproductions that will be available to the exhibit (photographs, but also potentially paintings and other visual arts).   

In short, I think it would be a good idea to use photographs from a variety of sources, and maybe provide something like a booklet for exhibit-goers to choose from and customize their own stereoscopic viewing experience. So in addition to some of the Freund photographs of Joyce and his social circle, and Quinn's 1970s photographs of *Ulysses* locations (note: there is a strongly worded copyright page in this book; look into fair use rules, maybe contact the author), I might include other Special Collections reproductions from the English 560 asset list; I might also use some of Michael Stevens' personal photographs of contemporary Dublin from his year at Trinity College; I might even use something as blatantly anachronistic and geographically inappropriate as my own photographs of Victoria (maybe of the James Joyce pub?). Again, this would also fit in with the "Long Now" theme of the exhibit, emphasizing resonances of the novel over time and space.  



## Some thoughts and questions regarding Week 7 readings  

25 February, 2013  

Re: Moretti's ["Conjectures on World Literature"](http://newleftreview.org/II/1/franco-moretti-conjectures-on-world-literature)  

Between Moretti, Ramsay, Manovitch, and to some extent Samuels/ McGann, this is the first I've ever really read much about "distance reading" and I wonder how much of its emergence as a critical practice has to do with technological innovations. 
This is especially interesting to think about with respect to Moretti, who doesn't really talk explicitly about computers in his critical practices, but who -- like Manovitch -- is very much interested in the kinds of huge sample sizes that only computers can really deal with.
So how new is distance reading, and how closely does its emergence correspond with developments in computation and the web? Moretti shows parenthetically how close reading has dominated "from the new criticism to deconstruction," and explains its domination in ideological terms: "you invest so much in individual texts *only* if you think that very few of them matter" (57). But how much does the emergence of distance reading owe to critics actually overcoming this ideology versus the development of computer programs and availability of data on the web?
As is probably clear by my entries on [Bloom Vision](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/NeedsAssessment/HainNeeds.md), I'm interested in the relationships between technological innovations and the emerging paradigms, art forms, and disciplines they enable (traditionally, I've focused on cinema, photography, increasingly architecture; in the context of 507 and my work at the Maker Lab, I'm trying to adapt this approach to digital technologies). So, what about distance reading? 
It's not something I practice, or that I'm even particularly familiar with, but these articles -- especially those, like Moretti's, that don't explicitly talk about computers -- have led me to start thinking about the technologies that have enabled the emergence of what seems to me a fairly recent development in critical practice. 
All the more so, because the computer is conspicuously absent here.  

Re: Ramsay and ["Algorithmic Criticism"](http://nora.lis.uiuc.edu:3030/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405148641/9781405148641.xml&doc.view=print&chunk.id=ss1-6-7&toc.depth=1&toc.id=0)  

I'm blown away by ![table 26.2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xy77o9n5czztg1v/Table%2026.2.png); Ramsay's right to point out that this kind of information does little more than confirm what a reader familiar with *The Waves* would already know, but I'm blown away by how accurate a confirmation it offers.


Re: Samuels and McGann: ["Deformance and Interpretation"](http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&type=summary&url=/journals/new_literary_history/v030/30.1mcgann.html)
  
I like to think I'm usually, if not always, receptive to new models of criticism, especially those that emphasize practice, but I found myself more convinced by (and interested in) McGann and Samuels' later point -- that all criticism has a deformative aspect -- than some of the material on deformative criticism proper.
From McGann and Samuels' initial examples -- forgery and  "mistaken and deviant readings produced, for example, by students unaware of an ignorance in their historical or linguistic understanding" (35) -- I found myself skeptical of the benefits of deformative criticism in practice: what would a positive or useful deformative criticism look like?
And I was surprised to find the extent to which the examples of deformation in criticism of Wallace Stevens' poetry relied on traditional (normative, to use Samuels/ McGann's term) expository interpretation. But in a way, I guess this works to underline their illuminating point that deformation is a factor in all critical interpretation.
What I found most interesting was the way in which Samuels and McGann show the interrelation between genre, or mode in writing, and the types of interpretation associated with it (i.e. prose taking on a scientific function, which is historically situated, contributing to our understanding and use of prose as always expository). If "Criticism (scholarship as well as interpretation) tends to imagine itself as an informative rather than a deformative activity" (33), to what extent are the modes of expository prose (in general) and essay-writing (in particular) responsible for the types of criticisms we perform?
What genres, media, methodologies *etc.* might be better suited to doing the kind of criticism McGann and Samuels outline here? And how might DH-tools allow for greater possibilities for deformative criticism?

Re: Manovitch and [Cultural Analytics](http://www.manovich.net/cultural_analytics.pdf)  

I'm not sure I understand the obsession with size and scale (big data, big screens) nor the apparent imperative on the visual here. Cultures are expressed in a variety of forms; is Manovitch's insistence on strictly visual expressions of culture hegemonic in some way?   

What is potentially lost in "thinking of culture as data... that can be mined and visualized"? The expression "mining" for me suggests a kind of appropriation, and begs the question of purpose or intent: who will use this cultural "data" and to what kinds of use? This gets a little scary in the section on "possible commercial applications": "Cultural Analytics should be of interest to providers of media metrics, trend forecasters, social media companies and, in principle, *all big media companies and publishers*."     

I do, however, like the gesture of situating the project of Cultural Analytics into a history of technologies not only influencing cultures, but creating new disciplines and modes of cultural analysis (from slides to art history; from projectors to film studies). 

## Data Model

12 February, 2013

For my data model I've decided to do a simple [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ald25Z0nufmWdHUyVUdYVWIzY2VWZUJpdklrT1dFRWc#gid=0) to keep track of metadata like file name, type, format, date, and the stereoscope component. 
Initially, my data will just be several images of each stereoscope component, which I'll keep in an open directory (dropbox? Drive?) arranged by component type; after that I'm going to start sticthing the images of each component into 3D models that can be printed and then assembled.
It's kind of a strange process, because production here actually precedes most of the modelling; in this way, it's like reverse modelling -- like the the exact opposite of modelling in, say, architectural projects (where it would be absurd to build a building and *then* make a scale model).
But at the same time, I'm working from a kit where the components are cut from templates, so there are physical models out there prior to production, prior to assemblage; there's also the fact that the kit is a replica of an unpatented nineteenth-century technology, itself an improved version of earlier stereoscopes, so it's difficult to pin down any sort of originary model.
It's been interesting to start to think generally about models, and about processes of production and reproduction in both digital and non-digital (industrial) environments.
