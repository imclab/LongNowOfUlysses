1. I finished uploading all my web contents for viewing. Everything is pretty much as good as it's going to get.

2. I altered my CSS menus on the homepage to arrange the texts by chapter, rather than alphabetically. The class thought this was a good idea, and I agreed. So I did it. 

I'm VERY happy that I've met all my project goals thus far. This all went exactly according to plan, but definitely better than expected!

3. WOOT!
