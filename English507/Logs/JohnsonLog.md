Lots happening lately, but looking at wireframing in particular as of late. Since much of our prototype will depend on mockups created in Balsamiq, getting familiar with making effective wireframes will be pretty key. 


This is handy as a really beginner guide.

http://www.wirify.com/ -- This looks interesting, but I wonder if copyright issues etc come into play here? Will likely be using this this weekend to look at how some of these gamified 'lifestyle' sites are constructed (Strava, Budge, Kobo etc) 

This is great, too: [http://wireframes.tumblr.com/] -- Offers some useful insight into mobile app development etc. 

[http://www.giftrocket.com/blog/how-i-learned-to-design] -- This in particular is helpful; offers good insight into how one should approach app development with little design background, along with some good insight in how to approach making effective mockups. 

Hoping to start sketching up some mockups this weekend, along with plenty of reading for this project/507. More to come.
