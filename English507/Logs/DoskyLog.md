## Work Done

This week I established data form and model (provided by Timeline.js) that I will be using.

Refined the prompt for the annotations and created a Google form that I will use to collect data that I will then input into my data model.

Contacted a group of students at another university and invited them to provide annotations for “Nausicaa.”

Sought out other groups of students who are currently studying *Ulysses* and will contact them after receiving feedback from 507 classmates.

Thinking about how to ensure that the work I am doing will not become obsolete. What role will my timeline play after the exhibit? In what ways can it continue to be useful?

Throughout the week I will doing some reading about the way conceptualize time has shifted in a digital age. (David Harvey’s [The Condition of Postmodernity](http://libcom.org/files/David%20Harvey%20-%20The%20Condition%20of%20Postmodernity.pdf) This will likely inform the final reflection I will produce on my project, and will also push me towards thinking concretely about how I can display my timeline so as to capture our compressed sense of time in a digital age, while still operating within the parameters that Timeline.js’s data model sets.

I will also read about Hyper/Deep attention, once again keeping in mind what I want the end goals of my project to be.
