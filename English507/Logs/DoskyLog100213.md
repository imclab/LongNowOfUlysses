This past week I have collected some data and tested the model. For the most part, the model appears to work well. However, after doing a test run in 507, I recognize that I will need to sift through the data to ensure that URLs appear only in fields that support them. Timeline.js does not respond well (if at all) to misplaced URLs, in particular. It will also be necessary for me to do some editorial work before the entries are published. This has caused me to rethink the scope of my project. I would like all the excerpts to be annotated, but depending on the amount of labour this may not be feasible given the timeframe for the project. I also worry that 

About two weeks ago I think I was a little bit idealistic when I was in the planning stage of recruiting respondents. Now, I recognize that finding people to annotate the excerpts may prove a more difficult endeavour than I had originally thought. I e-mailed a couple professors who passed information on to their students, but I am yet to receive any responses. Humph. I'm working on finding more groups provide annotations. Goals for the week: Track down more respondents, post the form to Reddit, and hope for the best.

Thinking about collaborating with Zaqir in some capacity? We talked and we agreed that our projects might supplement each other well. We also decided that collaborating might be most effective in terms of the material we produce for the gallery.
