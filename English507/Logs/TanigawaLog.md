## Feb 4
Clarified two approaches to use: 
* Overlay of historical maps using images of objects from exhibits as "pushpin" icons
* Tactile representation of temporality in _Ulysses_

## Feb 5
Began metadata spreadsheets via google doc
two separate sheets, one for the maps and one for the text: 

* Ulysses (text) Data Model for Tactile Temporal Map
* Map Data Model

## Feb 9
Looked at Maps from Special Collections 
Reviewed Google Earth KML Tutorial for information on data model requirements
Required fields: 

*  PlaceMark
* GroundOverlay
* Style

## Feb 11
Looked at Sample KML files in Google Earth
Added two sets of sample data from Telemachus to Ulysses (text) Data Model for Tactile Temporal Map, including latitude and longitude of text location, approximate word count locatable in area and approximate total word count of novel. 
Created Sample XML documents for KML data model: 

* Eng507MappingPlaceMark.xml
* Engl507MappingGroundOverlay.xml
* Engl507MappingStyleIcon.xml

* chose three maps from the Special Collection's archive: the Anglo-Norman invasion map, 1876, and the 1925 maps
* scanned the three maps in Vue Scan
* because of small scanning bed, the images were scanned in four segments

## Feb 26
met with Alex to solidify plans 
Notes from Meeting: 

*Tactile Temporality: 
** Why: brings the digital into the physical   
** why is tactile better than something like a heatmap
** immediately engaging 
** two digital versions (online and materially digital versions of a map) that speak to each other 
** thinking about what is possible in the material realm that is not possible in the digital realm 
** different ways of thinking about the “digital” interface
** how is touching time important? 
** because we can use a 3d printer
** analogue to digital to analogue
** how do the electronic and the tactile speak to each other?
** what different types of experiences can they produce and how do these experiences speak to each other? 
** importance of interface for establishing user interaction with digital maps (web interface and tactile interface)

* Action Items: 
** Explain the rationale
** Ask Jentery about 3d modelling of the map
** word count ratio
** subjectivity of time 
** rationale as bringing together the two projects

* Historical representational map: 
** bringing the physical exhibit objects into the digital 
** long now of ulysses 
** use medieval dublin maps 
** would the 1925 map work better? closer to the publication date of Ulysses. We will use this one.  
** knotted line where it tears open to reveal something that wasn’t there before
** maps disrupting one another
** showing special collections materials

* Action list: 
** grab stuff from the asset list that we can locate on our own 
** 1) stitch maps and make sure that they can layer onto each other (photoshop)
** 2) layer maps
** 3) render the exhibit objects as placemarks
** 4) locate exhibit objects in their space within Dublin/Ulysses
** 5) figure out how to layer maps (icon in google earth) (we can layer it on mars!!!) 
** 6) explain the rationale 

* Questions: 
** are we using google earth thing? Yes! At least for the demo

* Alex:
** stitch digitized maps in Photoshop
** Grab (and geolocate) some assets from 560
** learn more about KML
** Think through interface possibilities for articulating correspondences between two digital maps (digital material convergence, etc.)

* Katie: 
** E-mail Jentery re: 3d modelling-- is it do-able and what are the constraints? 
** Moretti on Graphs, Maps, Trees
** take a look at the asset list, id locatable ones, and find images online for now as placeholders
figure out how to turn the images into placemarkers
** write rationale for the use of the maps

## March 2
* selected objects and located objects for test Google Earth layering project: 
** Jug (Martello Tower)
** Martello Tower (Martello Tower)
** Redlight district materials (Monto, around Talbot, Amiens, Gardiner, and Seán McDermott St.)
** Kidney (Dlugacz's Butcher shop a few block from 7 Eccles St.)
** Frying pan (Bloom's house on 7 Eccles St.)
** Sweny's soap (Sweny's pharmacy, 1 Lincoln Place, Dublin 2.) 
** Painting of Sunbather's (Ormond Hotel Bar)

## March 4
* Met with Alex to finalize details for the test run.
* Edited Needs Assessment to reflect current project concerns
* Meeting Notes: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Gwu04LTJupBAA7-HARtITq0Wk5hx8haCIqnB5la50s/edit

* Alex stitched together and layerd onto Google earth
* I located the objects and their images on the maps
* I created the demo video for test 1

## March 5 
* Created Iteration One file 

## March 7
Choosing objects from asset list to locate based on following criteria: 
* Locatable in Dublin 
* Relevant to the novel
* Present in the exhibit
* Historical significance (with particular lean towards objects that evoke this history of English colonization of Ireland) 

Objects
* Chochrane's ginger ale
* army recruiting poster
* Leah the play
* Pennies
* Kidney
* Martellow Tower
* Key 
* Clock
* Madeleine Box
* Curling iron
* Infant clothes
* Derby Mugs
* old pornography
* hair pins
* hip flask
* blood
* coaster
* apostle spoons
* cloth
* olives
* doormat
* Sweeny's lemon soap
* guinness glass
* frying pan 
* red quinoa
* british sweets
* sunbathers

## March 8
* I started by locating objects manually through the text. This is not a good idea, or rather, it is more time consuming than the alternative. 
* I switched from manually locating the objects to doing a search for the objects in the MVP's uploaded chapters of Ulysses. where possible.
* When chapters were not available through the MVP site, I turned to Gutenberg's Ulysses to locate the objects. 
* The data is entered into an excel spreadsheet with the categories: Item, Location, Chapter, Passage (the passage that contains the object)
* Objects located with all data included: 
** ginger ale
**  Derby mug
** old pornography 
** Sweny's soap
** kidney
 
## March 15
* Neatline sandbox Ulysses mapping 
* How do you layer maps? 
* The timeline function could be very helpful for expressing the historical context of objects

## March 19 
* Meeting with Alex
** Katie to: locate objects, decide method for ratio of place/time for 3D map, figure out ratios
* Confirm the use of Neatline
* Transfer data from Google Earth 

## March 20 
* Surveying maps of Ulysses projects (Yale, Boston College) 
* Other maps of Ulysses imagine the path taken by the characters, our map hopes to render a tactile representation of space in Ulysses as experienced by the reader via word count
* How can we use the scholarly data provided by BC and Yale regarding the location of characters to develop our own map? Do we use their data as a way to check our work? 

## March 23
* Flushing out context for the project with Moretti's Graphs, Maps, and Trees
* Locating Objects: 
** Leah (the play)
** pennies
** martello Tower
** key
