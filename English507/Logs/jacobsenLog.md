# Week of January 22nd

I'm trying to articulate what it means to read print in the digital age and why I continue to resist the digital and insist on the superior value of print. Surely it is only personal. I tend to interact with screen-based text very differently than print-based material. My brain only seems to be able to scan screens, and I have a more difficult time absorbing digital texts that are longer or more complex. I also get distracted so easily when I am in front of a screen! (I just checked my email mid-sentence).

Thinking about how to articulate the importance of print is difficult for me, beyond stating my own personal preference. N. Katherine Hayles's ["Hyper and Deep Attention: 
The Generational Divide in Cognitive Modes"](http://engl449_spring2010_01.commons.yale.edu/files/2009/11/hayles.pdf) has been helpful as way to start thinking about different modes of perception and why I might have a difficult time absorbing digital media. 

At this stage, thinking about how I might contribute to "The Long Now of Ulysses" has generated far more questions than answers. To begin to conceptualize what I might do, I first looked at examples of "print+" texts and found many compelling, thought-provoking, and imaginative books.

[Visual Editions](http://www.visual-editions.com/) is an excellent example of how print is being re-imagined. Jonathan Safran Foer's [*Tree of Codes*](http://www.visual-editions.com/our-books/tree-of-codes) is a book that re-creates a new narrative from an existing text, and also is truly a book that cannot be read or experienced digitally. The same goes for Adam Thirwell's [*Kapow\!*](http://www.visual-editions.com/our-books/kapow), with its unfolding pages and typographic tricks that map the trajectory of the narrative.

I also spent time looking at the astonishing work of other artists. I particularly like the work of [Lauren Redness](http://www.laurenredniss.com/), especially *Radioactive* and *Century Girl*. 

Graham Rawle's [*Woman's World*](http://www.grahamrawle.com/womansworld/index.html), a full-length novel written entirely in collage from 1960s women's magazine, is amazing. [Design Made in Germany](http://www.designmadeingermany.de/2013/1171/au_jahrbuecher2012_04/) appears to be a good design resource, as does [It's That Nice](http://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/mark-lazenby). One of my favourite blogs, *Brain Pickings* includes some inspiring selections in its [Best Books of 2012](http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2012/12/26/best-books-2012-reader-favorites/), including *The Where, The Way, and the How*, a book that considers how a sense of wonder might be lost in our age of instant information, and Yayoi Kusama’s *Alice and Wonderland*. 

Jentery pointed me to Tom Phillip's truly brilliant [*Humument*](http://humument.com/). One is able to flip through *Humument* online, and this led me to question the validity of my argument that my design would or could require reading in print. Of course, I do think I would have a much greater appreciation for the book if I could read the print copy. I guess it is like looking at an image of a painting on the internet and seeing the original, maybe? I also am drawn to the more mathematically-based and random textual processes used by groups such as OuLipo. An interesting example, that actually seems to perform better in its digital than its analog manifestation, is Raymond Queneau's [*One Hundred Thousand Billion Sonnets (Cent Mille Milliards de poèmes)*](http://www.growndodo.com/wordplay/oulipo/10%5e14sonnets.html).

Beck Hansen's latest "album," [*Song Reader*](http://songreader.net/), also might be useful for sparking ideas. A visually-inspiring compilation of sheet music never before released or recorded, *Song Reader* asks its users to upload their own recorded versions of the compositions and share them on the web. The album is meant to be a signpost, marking what it means to write, create, and share music in 2012. I like how Beck is incorporating his "users" into the production of music, and I think there is potential here for my own project. 

All in all, after spending hours looking at beautiful artistic creations, I am left to wonder what I can contribute. I question what I have proposed. On the one hand, exquisite books like *Humument* are not necessarily responding to the digital-age per se. And illustrated books are certainly a pre-digital genre. I also feel my own hesitation at even suggesting that literature should need any other enhancement than what it offers solely through text. Admittedly, I shudder at Hayles's suggestion that we are moving more and more into the age of "hyper attention." I don't want to let go of my own assumptions that hierarchize and moralize and binarize activities, championing those that fall into the deep concentration category. I don't think books should have to change! But, obviously, it is not my job to decide what should or should not happen (and my opinion really does not change anything anyway, does it?), but instead to look at what is happening, in this moment. And what *that* might mean for the future of the book.

So, I leave with some interesting recent observations about book culture that, again, only add to the mounting lists of questions I have about what my project might do. A recent article from *The Wall Street Journal*, "Don't Burn Your Books--Print is Here to Stay" has this to say about digital books:

>These are, by design, the most disposable of books. We read them quickly and have no
desire to hang onto them after we've turned the last page. We may even be a little
embarrassed to be seen reading them, which makes anonymous digital versions all the
more appealing. The "Fifty Shades of Grey" phenomenon probably wouldn't have
happened if e-books didn't exist.

>Readers of weightier fare, including literary fiction and narrative nonfiction, have
been less inclined to go digital. They seem to prefer the heft and durability, the
tactile pleasures, of what we still call "real books"—the kind you can set on a
shelf.

>E-books, in other words, may turn out to be just another format—an even
lighter-weight, more disposable paperback. That would fit with the discovery that
once people start buying digital books, they don't necessarily stop buying printed
ones. In fact, according to Pew, nearly 90% of e-book readers continue to read
physical volumes. The two forms seem to serve different purposes.

I find it fascinating that the author suggests that digitization is changing the way books are read, consumed, and even written! I will have to think more about this one.

A December 2012 article from *The Gaurdian*, "Print book sales rise hailed as a sign of a fightback in a digital world," suggests that the rise of print books sales is largely in cookbooks and celebrity memoirs. The appeal: the images, which do not transmit as easily to digital formats. Interesting!

Compelling, although I am not totally sure how it relates to an argument about literary text, this [website](http://www.blurb.com/instagram-books) offers to compile Instagram photos into a hard-cover print book. 

Lastly, the website [Read Print](http://www.readprint.com/), a place "Where books and people meet." Outfitted with its very own book shelf and thousands of free books available online, *Read Print* is a place to read and chat about books with other readers. I know I am just hanging on to my own prejudices, but I just can't wrap my mind around the internet as a place. A place where "people meet" seems even more ludicrous! I even balked at the bookshelf. I have a lot of work to do to unravel my resistance to the digital!

Mostly, I am stuck trying to imagine how my book will differ from other visual instances of literature--graphic novels, illustrated editions, artist's books, etc. How do I think about print text at the moment of its digitization?
