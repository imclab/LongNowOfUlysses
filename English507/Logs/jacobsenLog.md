I am looking at web-use statistics, bounce rates, computation and vision online, attention economy, usability studies, and web analytics to think about how screen-based reading differs from print-based reading, trying to conceptualize what this might mean in terms of how, in our current cultural moment, we read and interpret and interact with text in different mediums. In other words, how might reading on the web affect other reading habits? What would it look like to transfer this type of reading to another medium, such as a print novel like *Ulysses*?

First, I searched something like "website use statistics." One of the first pages I looked at, [Internet World Stats](http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm), is interesting in its own right, although maybe not potentially helpful for conceptualizing my project. What I found compelling was the stark contrast between percentage of interenet users per continent. For example, North America, by far the highest, at 78%; Africa, the lowest at about 16%; followed by Asia, at 36%. The world total being just 34%. I don't want to linger too long on this, but it did make me question some of the assumptions about shifts in cognitive perception and the "digital age," considering that this paradigm shift may be perceived differently in less-affluent geographies.

Funnily enough, when I was trying to take a screen shot of this webpage, I clicked accidently on a [Cisco](http://www.cisco.com/web/CA/worktogether/index.html?POSITION=3rd+Party+Banner&COUNTRY_SITE=ca&CAMPAIGN=TomorrowStartsHere&CREATIVE=CS_Brand_Collaboration_KWContextual&REFERRING_SITE=GoogleDisplayNetwork) advertisement. Telling me to "Be Everywhere," and using statistics to evidence the importance of in-person collaboration and facial expressions, the add promotes "In-person remote presence" via mobile devices! Again, not really relevant to a remediation of *Ulysses*, but interesting to think about how presence and time and space are being re-conceptualized. After all, what does it really mean to be somewhere? Or to be everywhere, for that matter?

[NeilsenWire](http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/consumer/the-connected-devices-age-ipads-kindles-smartphones-and-the-connected-consumer/) had some fascinating stats on the age and gender of e-reader users. I had not considered that gender might factor into how one reads. David Haden of [KindleBlog](http://kindleebooks.wordpress.com/2010/09/29/kindle-user-statistics/) has this to say about the iPad as a reader:
>"Broadly, Kindle owners are older, affluent, and educated — while iPad owners are younger, 65% are male, and they have less education and are more susceptible to advertising. Typical Apple fan-boys, by the sound of it. I wonder if very many iPad users are regularly using it as an ebook reader? Not many, I’d guess — tiring backlit screen, heavy to hold, hot, short battery life, etc. iBooks sales are dire for contemporary fiction, apparently." 

Obviously advertorial, but nevertheless, it suggests that gender might affect usage and engagement. Perhaps comparable to Hayles's suggestion that the hyper/deep concentrational divide is generational?

[Velvet Blues Web Design & Development](http://www.velvetblues.com/web-development-blog/google-analytics-high-bounce-rate-bad/) has some suggestions on how to manage bounce rates, that might be somewhat helpful:

>How Can You Minimize Bad Bounce Rates?

It is easy to minimize bad bounce rates. Here are some tips.

1. Evaluate page content and make sure that it is well-written and matches what visitors expect to find after reading the headline or title of the page.
2. Make pages more appealing by reducing excessive advertisements and fixing other unsightly features.
3. Determine whether your website looks trustworthy and professional. In today's world of beautiful user-friendly websites, many visitors quickly leave sites that look amateur.
4. Open external links in a new window. If you link to a lot of external website or embed advertisements, sometimes visitors will click these links and leave your website. Use target="_blank" where possible to give visitors the chance to stay on your site.
5. Split up long articles into separate pages. Sometimes visitors are intimidated by the possibility of reading large amounts of content. Don't overwhelm them.
6. If using paid marketing campaigns, make sure that your page targets the right keywords so that visitors expectations are satisfied.
7. Improve load time. The quickest way to turn a visitor away is to have a slow-loading website.
8. Make your website sticky by proving easy access to related content.


[6S Marketing](http://www.6smarketing.com/infographic-canadian-internet-usage-statistics/) has some helpful information about Canadian usage stats. 4.8 billion Google searches performed in Canada monthly; 16% of those searches have never been performed before!

[Smashing Magazine](www.smashingmagazine.com) looks like a great resource. "The Path to Advertising Nirvana" claims that, "as a general rule, when people surf the Web, they’re in control of the experience. If someone wants information about a particular topic, they might query Google or look up an article on Wikipedia. Regardless of what they do, they choose how to obtain the information they want."

This is super interesting. I wonder if there is a valuable comparison to be made here? A book does not allow you this type of choice or freedom or gratification. Hmmm.

["10 Useful Usability Findings and Guidelines"](http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2009/09/24/10-useful-usability-findings-and-guidelines/#more-11389) is great! Including information on spacing, fonts, and where eyes tend to go (faces!). Also, users usually won't scroll on a first visit to a webpage!

Michael Martin's ["Typographic Design Patterns and Best Practices"](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/08/20/typographic-design-survey-best-practices-from-the-best-blogs/) could also be incredibly useful! 

Jack Cheng's ["The Slow Web"](http://blog.jackcheng.com/post/25160553986/the-slow-web) contains some great insight, especially the section "Timely vs. Real Time."
 
Amazon/Kindle's ["Most Highlighted Passages of All Time"](https://kindle.amazon.com/most_popular) is amazing! The site explains how Kindle chooses the "most meaningful passages" quantitatively and qualitatively, with distinctions being made across users. The most popular book currently is Suzanne Collin's *Catching Fire* from *The Hunger Games* series. Interestingly, the highlights here all seem to be rather banal and general. Such as this, the most popular of all:
>"Because sometimes things happen to people and they’re not equipped to deal with them."

Or, third runner up:
>"“I wish I could freeze this moment, right here, right now, and live in it forever,” he says."

Second-most-popular novel (and one of my absolute least favourite works of prose ever), Austen's *Pride and Prejudice*, with this quote heading up the list:
>"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."

Is that irony?

Largely, *The Hunger Games* series wins out. What I find most compelling here, just from a cursory peruse of the most-popular quotes, is that they all seem to reflect what I imagine readers would consider 'universal' or 'timeless' sentiments about love and marriage and human nature, etc. Taken out of their textual context, they tend to lose all meaning. Most strikingly in Wilde's *The Picture of Dorian Greene*.

Jonathan Beller's ["Paying Attention"](http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/24/beller.php) is amazingly helpful. Here is an example of what he has to say about "attention economy":
>"Like clean air, attention is something that once could be had for free but is now being encroached upon as the next and perhaps final frontier. Attention is now a commodity, and a special kind of commodity at that."

Even better?:
>"psychoanalysis, structuralism, semiotics, deconstruction, post-structuralism, and post-modernism and culminates, as it were, with the famous disappearance of the referent (“being”) from representation and the near-simultaneous decline of master narratives. These intellectual movements, all really within the province demarcated by the field of linguistics (which itself came into being with the advent of cinema, very likely as a result of the suspicion that language was simply one medium among others), are thus to be understood as representing various inflection points of the increasing failure of language (and therefore humanism) laboring under the intensive onslaught of visuality."

!:
>" All evidence points in this direction: that in the twentieth century, capital first posited and now presupposes looking as productive labor, and, more generally, posited attention as productive of value."

!!:
>"The generalized gathering of human productive capacities under the complex regulation of the matrix of relations that constitute spectacular society simultaneously extract profit and manufacture “consent.” With the rise of visuality comes the erosion of language and therefore of certain kinds of reason."

>"his final subsumption of our cognitive-linguistic capacities by capital (and its huge industries dedicated to the production of signs) is the mark of the real subsumption of society by capital and the full economicization not only of culture but of what was once called “human.” That humanity, whether dancing and wailing on our screens, repressed beyond their frames, or stammering in our heads is the specter haunting the society of the spectacle—in the world of paying attention, humanity has become its own ghost."

Okay, I just keep finding more and more! Paul Ford's ["The Web Is a Customer Service Medium"](http://www.ftrain.com/wwic.html) has some fascinating insights about internet usability, and his [*Save Publishing*](http://www.savepublishing.com/) finds and tweets tweetable lines of text from any webpage content!

Craig Mod's [*Post-Artifact Books and Publishing](http://craigmod.com/journal/post_artifact/)!
The book, the digital, and its relationship to time:
>"With digital impermanence (a new kind of ephemerality) comes two concepts key to the future of storytelling and books:
We can continuously develop a text in realtime, erasing the preciousness imbued by printing. And because of this ...
Time itself becomes an active ingredient in authorship (in contrast to authorship happening in a seemingly timeless place, a finished product suddenly emerging)."

[*Open Bookmarks*](http://www.openbookmarks.org/social-reading/) defines what it calls "social reading." Hmmm. 

*UX Magazine* also might be helpful, including [this article](http://uxmag.com/articles/eye-tracking-and-web-usability-a-good-fit) on 
eye-tracking and usability.

*UX Myths* is the best! Lots of good stuff here, especially [Myth #1](http://uxmyths.com/post/647473628/myth-people-read-on-the-web): "People Read on the Web"

NN/g (Neilson Norman Group) also offers actual stats and percentages on reading habits and eye-tracking! Especially ["How Users Read the Web"](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-users-read-on-the-web/).

So many helpful resources. Now, what do I do with it all??



# Week of January 22nd

I'm trying to articulate what it means to read print in the digital age and why I continue to resist the digital and insist on the superior value of print. Surely it is only personal. I tend to interact with screen-based text very differently than print-based material. My brain only seems to be able to scan screens, and I have a more difficult time absorbing digital texts that are longer or more complex. I also get distracted so easily when I am in front of a screen! (I just checked my email mid-sentence).

Thinking about how to articulate the importance of print is difficult for me, beyond stating my own personal preference. N. Katherine Hayles's ["Hyper and Deep Attention: 
The Generational Divide in Cognitive Modes"](http://engl449_spring2010_01.commons.yale.edu/files/2009/11/hayles.pdf) has been helpful as way to start thinking about different modes of perception and why I might have a difficult time absorbing digital media. 

At this stage, thinking about how I might contribute to "The Long Now of Ulysses" has generated far more questions than answers. To begin to conceptualize what I might do, I first looked at examples of "print+" texts and found many compelling, thought-provoking, and imaginative books.

[Visual Editions](http://www.visual-editions.com/) is an excellent example of how print is being re-imagined. Jonathan Safran Foer's [*Tree of Codes*](http://www.visual-editions.com/our-books/tree-of-codes) is a book that re-creates a new narrative from an existing text, and also is truly a book that cannot be read or experienced digitally. The same goes for Adam Thirwell's [*Kapow\!*](http://www.visual-editions.com/our-books/kapow), with its unfolding pages and typographic tricks that map the trajectory of the narrative.

I also spent time looking at the astonishing work of other artists. I particularly like the work of [Lauren Redness](http://www.laurenredniss.com/), especially *Radioactive* and *Century Girl*. 

Graham Rawle's [*Woman's World*](http://www.grahamrawle.com/womansworld/index.html), a full-length novel written entirely in collage from 1960s women's magazine, is amazing. [Design Made in Germany](http://www.designmadeingermany.de/2013/1171/au_jahrbuecher2012_04/) appears to be a good design resource, as does [It's That Nice](http://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/mark-lazenby). One of my favourite blogs, *Brain Pickings* includes some inspiring selections in its [Best Books of 2012](http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2012/12/26/best-books-2012-reader-favorites/), including *The Where, The Way, and the How*, a book that considers how a sense of wonder might be lost in our age of instant information, and Yayoi Kusama’s *Alice and Wonderland*. 

Jentery pointed me to Tom Phillip's truly brilliant [*Humument*](http://humument.com/). One is able to flip through *Humument* online, and this led me to question the validity of my argument that my design would or could require reading in print. Of course, I do think I would have a much greater appreciation for the book if I could read the print copy. I guess it is like looking at an image of a painting on the internet and seeing the original, maybe? I also am drawn to the more mathematically-based and random textual processes used by groups such as OuLipo. An interesting example, that actually seems to perform better in its digital than its analog manifestation, is Raymond Queneau's [*One Hundred Thousand Billion Sonnets (Cent Mille Milliards de poèmes)*](http://www.growndodo.com/wordplay/oulipo/10%5e14sonnets.html).

Beck Hansen's latest "album," [*Song Reader*](http://songreader.net/), also might be useful for sparking ideas. A visually-inspiring compilation of sheet music never before released or recorded, *Song Reader* asks its users to upload their own recorded versions of the compositions and share them on the web. The album is meant to be a signpost, marking what it means to write, create, and share music in 2012. I like how Beck is incorporating his "users" into the production of music, and I think there is potential here for my own project. 

All in all, after spending hours looking at beautiful artistic creations, I am left to wonder what I can contribute. I question what I have proposed. On the one hand, exquisite books like *Humument* are not necessarily responding to the digital-age per se. And illustrated books are certainly a pre-digital genre. I also feel my own hesitation at even suggesting that literature should need any other enhancement than what it offers solely through text. Admittedly, I shudder at Hayles's suggestion that we are moving more and more into the age of "hyper attention." I don't want to let go of my own assumptions that hierarchize and moralize and binarize activities, championing those that fall into the deep concentration category. I don't think books should have to change! But, obviously, it is not my job to decide what should or should not happen (and my opinion really does not change anything anyway, does it?), but instead to look at what is happening, in this moment. And what *that* might mean for the future of the book.

So, I leave with some interesting recent observations about book culture that, again, only add to the mounting lists of questions I have about what my project might do. A recent article from *The Wall Street Journal*, "Don't Burn Your Books--Print is Here to Stay" has this to say about digital books:

>These are, by design, the most disposable of books. We read them quickly and have no
desire to hang onto them after we've turned the last page. We may even be a little
embarrassed to be seen reading them, which makes anonymous digital versions all the
more appealing. The "Fifty Shades of Grey" phenomenon probably wouldn't have
happened if e-books didn't exist.

>Readers of weightier fare, including literary fiction and narrative nonfiction, have
been less inclined to go digital. They seem to prefer the heft and durability, the
tactile pleasures, of what we still call "real books"—the kind you can set on a
shelf.

>E-books, in other words, may turn out to be just another format—an even
lighter-weight, more disposable paperback. That would fit with the discovery that
once people start buying digital books, they don't necessarily stop buying printed
ones. In fact, according to Pew, nearly 90% of e-book readers continue to read
physical volumes. The two forms seem to serve different purposes.

I find it fascinating that the author suggests that digitization is changing the way books are read, consumed, and even written! I will have to think more about this one.

A December 2012 article from *The Gaurdian*, "Print book sales rise hailed as a sign of a fightback in a digital world," suggests that the rise of print books sales is largely in cookbooks and celebrity memoirs. The appeal: the images, which do not transmit as easily to digital formats. Interesting!

Compelling, although I am not totally sure how it relates to an argument about literary text, this [website](http://www.blurb.com/instagram-books) offers to compile Instagram photos into a hard-cover print book. 

Lastly, the website [Read Print](http://www.readprint.com/), a place "Where books and people meet." Outfitted with its very own book shelf and thousands of free books available online, *Read Print* is a place to read and chat about books with other readers. I know I am just hanging on to my own prejudices, but I just can't wrap my mind around the internet as a place. A place where "people meet" seems even more ludicrous! I even balked at the bookshelf. I have a lot of work to do to unravel my resistance to the digital!

Mostly, I am stuck trying to imagine how my book will differ from other visual instances of literature--graphic novels, illustrated editions, artist's books, etc. How do I think about print text at the moment of its digitization?
