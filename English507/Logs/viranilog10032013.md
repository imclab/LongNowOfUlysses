Solution to the problem of copyrighted material and previews:

[Flash Video Downloader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fvd-video-downloader/lfmhcpmkbdkbgbmkjoiopeeegenkdikp?hl=en) lets me take the previews directly from the hosting pages and download the shortened previews as mp3's.

I figure that if I combine these clips in the archive with metadata that either specifies the copyright or points to where the audio is available to buy, I will have done my duty. Archiving for cheap.
