#MEETING NOTES
##Jan. 28, 2012


How can we move away from positivism in our mapping practices?
        And do this without sacrificing the clarity of our maps.
Could we make anachronistic maps?
Enlarge or reduce areas of Dublin in Neatline based on the temporal space they occupy in the novel?


Use Google for micro maps proposed by 560 students?
Need Neatline to use historical maps.
Could split focus: micro maps for space and Neatline map for website.


Tim: wants to map “newtorked Ulysses”
Alex:Could map component parts of the first edition (source of paper? typesetters? Shakespeare & Co., etc.)


Katie: Shift focus to drafting Needs Assessment.


Tentative title: “Mapping Ulysses”
Should we draft two assessments: correspondences and afterlife.
Constraints of space really limit what we can do. So let’s focus on the website.


Correspondences: mapping street addresses of places that Joyce communicated with to compose Ulysses.
Afterlife: Map address of publisher? Translator?


Three maps: correspondances (objective map), afterlives (best ways of mapping), anachronistic or distorted maps. Could we layer the three maps (using Google Maps?) to make a larger image that hyperlinks to each map/layer? There would be clickable zones for each.


How can we enable deconstruction at the level of interface (i.e. the Knotted Line). What if the user enacts the deformations by clicking on/scrolling over sections of the historical map(s)?


What we need: Working with Flash?
        potential tools for converting Flash into HTML 5:
        https://www.google.com/doubleclick/studio/swiffy/ 
        http://cookbooks.adobe.com/post_How_to_convert_Flash_files_into_HTML5-18667.html 
Better to work with Flash or use Google Maps API for distortion?
Google Maps are interoperable; Flash is interactive.
Kt: *After looking at Google maps, I’m not sure they do the kind of layering we were hoping for. I could be wrong about this, though. Thoughts? 
Tim: Maybe something to ask Jentery about?


KT: Alex, for the map distortion of Ulysses to represent the time spent in each place in Dublin, does it make sense to use some kind of textual analysis to determine length of time spent in each place. E.g. divide the total number of words in the novel by the total number of words that describe events (or non-events) in a specific place? Say there’s something like 265,000 in Ulysses and there are 4,000 words in the red light district section..... would that help make the map distortions proporitional? [a]


Alex: What critical space do we ‘tear open’ by overlaying the production of the novel, itself with the historical and political issues that is narritivizes? What correspondences or ruptures may we find between these two layered networks in which the text is situated, both thematically and materially? Linkages between the national and the transnational?

WORKING TITLE - “Trolling Ulysses”

#Comments

[a]Alex Christie:
This is such a tough question! Because what if you have a long passage that represents a short period of time (I'm thinking of the last episode which is all stream-of-consciousness)? But on the other hand, how can we *quantitatively* determine something which is inherently subjective--temporality?


I like your idea because the method is solid. Would it be feasible to find out what amount of time each episode covers (would Stephen know?) and work off that?
________________
Katie Tanigawa:
Good idea-- it never hurts to ask the experts (Stephen and Jentery). :)
[b]Alex Christie:
I've been thinking through how space is politicized. How would we choose our historical maps? Could we perhaps choose map images that are tied to the historical or political importance of certain locations?
________________
Katie Tanigawa:
Good point. I was just going to use the maps housed in Special Collections. They have one set of historical maps that were collected by the National Irish something.

Alex Christie:
Awesome. Maybe that could help us pick which maps from the set to use and where to put parts of them?
________________
Katie Tanigawa:
I'm not sure I understand what you mean by put parts of them, but it sounds cool! Are you thinking for the flash animation to make a franken-map from the 1400-1948 maps of Dublin?
________________
Alex Christie:
Something like that. Does it sound too chaotic?


I'm thinking about how we can use anachronism to make arguments about why spaces matter (temporality, political significance, etc.)
________________
Katie Tanigawa:
That's really interesting! I'm not entirely sure how good the special collections maps are for this purpose, but there's no harm in trying!
[c]Alex Christie:
What's the distinction between the map and the site? Are we coding a site or inserting our layered map cake into the site for the exhibit? And who's making the site for the exhibit, btw?
________________
Alex Christie:
Sorry I'm just full of questions tonight.
________________
Katie Tanigawa:
Good question! I'd imagine it's just a page on the exhibit site.
________________
Amanda Hansen:
Is someone making an exhibit site? Or will we be it?
________________
Alex Christie:
Should we file this under support needed?
________________
Amanda Hansen:
Yes, we should.
________________
Katie Tanigawa:
Good call!
[d]Alex Christie:
Probably the hardest part right here. Should we prototype a small section first?
________________
Katie Tanigawa:
Yes
________________
Tim Personn:
Prototyping a smal section sound smart. I will do the same with my project.
[e]Alex Christie:
We'd have to use the same platform in order to pull this off.
[f]Katie Tanigawa:
mmmm. cake.
