# HyperLit - Weekly Log

## January 29, 2013

* During the past week Jon and I reviewed multiple technical solutions for the Google Calendar API and Geocaching gaming components.

![Sketching out possible solutions] NEED TO PLACE IMAGE ON GITHUB

* The Google Calendar API  solution would require us to learn basic HTML and CSS as well as Javascript and PHP, which we recognize is way too much to try and tackle in one term!
* Outlining the required processes made us realize that we needed to redefine our scope to be more achievable within the term.
* We decided to develop a speculative design model, with the final project goal this term being a video that follows a design fiction approach.
* We found a number of interesting sources to inform our project and get inspiration from, particularly: N. Katherine Hayles' "[Hyper and Deep Attention](http://www.mlajournals.org.ezproxy.library.uvic.ca/doi/abs/10.1632/prof.2007.2007.1.187)," Jonathan Lukens' "[Speculative Design and Technological Fluency](http://ijlm.net/fandf/10.1162/IJLM_a_00080)," [Budge](http://bud.ge/tour), and examples of [design fiction videos](http://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2012/03/curated-design-fiction-videos-the-videos-every-design-fiction-fan-should-see/).
* We envision a project that takes into consideration the key concepts outlined in Hayles' and Lukens' articles. On the one hand, we want to create a gamified app (or, for now, a model that shows what such an app could look like) that brings awareness to the "deep attention/hyper attention" divide and creates an accessible and even fun environment for all "types" of users to engage in the "deep attention" required to (critically/closely) read novels like *Ulysses*. On the other hand, we want to develop a design fiction video that demonstrates the vision as well as the social critique that our speculative design model will aim to communicate.
* The next step for us will be to articulate in more detail exactly what our model will look like, what exact components will be required to communicate our vision, and how we will develop it.
