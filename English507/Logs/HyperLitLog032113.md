# HyperLit Log - 21 March 2013

This week Jon and I met to plan the next steps in our HyperLit project development. With the basic wireframes completed, we've been thinking about ways to develop the satirical aspects of the app so that the different levels of critique (of socioeconomic structures, the academy, Web 2.0, and gamification) become more evident while maintaining a fun, if somewhat sarcastic, tone within a usable environment. As a new component to overcome this challenge, we have decided that we will incorporate a James Joyce Bot that will interact with the user throughout the HyperLit environment. The Joyce Bot would be a way to draw attention to the satirical nature of HyperLit through commentary on the user's daily activities, reading patterns, and the content of *Ulysses*. Thus the Bot would be a means to communicate the critique and satire, it would aid in the reading and interpretation of the text, and it would offer a computational challenge, since the Bot character would need to operate as an intelligent agent that performs Joyce's persona, communicates content-specific commentary, and offers a dynamic layer for the HCI aspect of the app.

Our immediate next step will be to create a few sketches of the Joyce Bot following the style of our web comics and to incorporate example instances and commentaries in our wireframes showing how the Bot would interact with users. We are also beginning to develop the speculative design fiction video concept and storyboard. The story concept for the video is based on a person (probably not a student or English Lit person) who intends to read more and then comes across HyperLit. The video would open on the person standing at home in front of a bookshelf full of unread books and sighing or somehow indicating the perceived impossibility of reading all this diffiult literature. Sitting back down at the computer, the person comes across HyperLit and signs up. As soon as the signup process is completed and the user's HyperLit homepage opens up, the Joyce Bot appears in the HyperLit environment and suddenly jumps out of the computer screen onto the person's shoulder. The video then goes on to show the person engaging in several different activities, with the Joyce Bot offering constant commentary that has a distinct Joycean character and tone and at times addresses the *Ulysses* text that the person is reading, but it also makes sarcastic comments about getting more badges or criticizes the way the user is spending the day. The concept for the video would be a parody of the [Google Shoe](http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/09/google-shoes/) video recently presented at SXSW.
