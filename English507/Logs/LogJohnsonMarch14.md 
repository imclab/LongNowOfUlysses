This log opens with a confession: I havebeen playing a really stupid iPhone game lately. The game is called "Jurrasic Park Builder." The game is just as it sounds: you have a slate of green jungle, some money, and options fobuilding options. As the game progresses, you are required to simply click on dinosaurs, buildings,eetc in order to gain additaionl money to build and maintain your park. You must click each buildingwithin a specific time, though, else your buildings stop making money. The option to purchase more money or coins to further expand your park with actual money is repeatedly recommended. A highscore leaderboard rerveals that users have either put SUBSTANTIAL amounts of time into the game, or substantial amounts of actual money .

Despite the fact that it is not that interesting to look at it, not that involving, and contains zero narrative, I find myself playing it. For some reason, this came of simply tapping on dinosaurs at select intervals has caught my attention. Why? I really have no idea. What I do know, is that I am most certainly being my attention is most certainly being exploited.. This is agame that requires ysou to schedule (loosely) in order to make more progress in the game. OAnd for what? Nothing, really. 

As I understand it, this is essentially a FarmVille clone. I have never played FarmVille, but I think I get the gist of it. What I find interesting is that this game that hinges upon simply seeing subtle changes in your park actually motivates people to play for subtantial abounts of time, or pay money. 

This game is, of course, everything that our HyerLit project rallies against. This program is clearly exploiting minutes out of my day for no real reason, and has created, in a sense, a digital economy out of my simply tapping little diunosaurs on the sCreen. And this game, of course, is exactly what Ian Bogost is critiquing with his game CowClicker. . So while I can never get those bits of my life back where I have played this game, I think something useful could come out of this. 

Specifically, I am toying witht he idea of incorporating an element into our HypplLit project that forces the user to be aware of how programs like FarmVille or Jurassic Park Builder problmatically draw on and exploiuit this notion of our attention as a kind of commodity, and how users are willing to throw three dollars here or there towareds a silly game where you simpy see upgrades to your park or farm or whatever. What if, I wonder, we could incoporate this into our HyperLit app? That is, to make available an option where a user can, instead of reading the segment, simply PURCHASEthe illusion of having read a chapter (and thus get the badge). However, I think it would be interesting if HyperLit made quite clear to show how uch money a user might spend on segments/badges, and thus making it very clear who put their "deep attention t" to work, and who simply copped out and bought the badge.
