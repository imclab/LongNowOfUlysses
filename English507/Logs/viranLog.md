#Zaqir's Log - Feb 9th 2013

I wrote that without making a Star Trek joke, and I'm very proud of myself for that.


The seperate sections of my project have now been divided into

1. Repo
2. Expression
3. Interoperability  


For the Repo:
Dublin Core will be the language in which I will document the metadata. The essential tags covered will be :Title, Subject, Description, Type, Source, Relation, Coverage (likely with Geo values), Creator, Publisher, Contributor, Rights, Date. and Format.

These should hopefully cover the metadata, although I'm sure I can find more if need be. I've begun reading through the [CDP Dublin Core Best Practices](http://www.mndigital.org/digitizing/standards/metadata.pdf)  and [Audio specific](http://www.mndigital.org/digitizing/standards/audio.pdf) manuals, if for nothing else than to get an idea of how other (far mor extensive) projects have gone about this.


For the Expression:
The independent expression of this data will be as part of the Long Now of Ulysses' web-presence. After speaking with Jentery, the goal here has come to be a visual page in which the dating and overlapping of the audio from remediations *of* Ulysses and works inspired *by* Ulysses will be expressed linearly, by applying a script to express the DC spreadsheet.

For the Interoperability: I have touched base with three other projects (Laura, David, Mitch) who may be using my collected audio and metadata in some respect, in order to figure out compatibility, relevance, and expression issues.
