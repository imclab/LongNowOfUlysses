##Generated draft of Tactile Map using Mudbox
#Worklfow

* Stitch scanned images of historical map using Photoshop

* Create plane in Mudbox
* Overlap stitched map using Projection tool ![](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BwJCaLpJjnXccmpRRTdsdHlOZFk/edit)
* Use sculpt tool to deform plane (elevations represent larger temporal)

* Export movie of map using Render>Create Turntable Movie
* Export layer as .stl file for printing

* see video of prototype [here] (https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BwJCaLpJjnXcLWJXaEJ6cHhUcDQ/edit )

#Mar 2-3
##Stitched scanned maps using Photoshop
* The sections of the map don't align perfectly when I stitch them
* I like the fact that the correspondence is imperfect--the breakages and anachronisms reveal the image's status as representation

##Overlaid maps on Dublin using Google Earth
* This is particularly difficult since I'm unfamiliar with the geography of Dublin
* The layers are currently not perfectly aligned with the base layer provided in Google Earth. This will take further work; for the time being, I do like the fact that these slight anachronisms frustrate the map's status as a reliable representation of geographic space.
* Trying to align the maps requires stretching and skewing them to fit Google's base layer.
* We want users to be able to drill down through the layers using each place mark,   to see how that item resonates historically (although this admittedly relies on the false assumption that the map layers represent history, rather than being historicized representations).

##Generated Test place marks with images
* Martello tower
* Sweny's pharmacy

##Exported layers and placemarks as .kml files

##Next steps
* Generate more place marks
* Read documentation on Google Maps API to determine how we will make this map available online
* Think through the links between the tactile map and the Google Map (both maps digitize Dublin through different modes of 'digital' representation).


#Data Model
##Three components
* Data for items that appear in exhibit (ask 560 folks to input this dataâ€”saves time)
* Data for temporality (character count/total char. count)
* Do we need a data model for : historical maps & tactile maps??
