##Agency in the Network 

In the process of researching the network of Joyce's contributors, it soon became obvious that there seem to be at least two *levels* of contribution to the network: some, such as Joyce's aunt Josephine Murray, whom he contacted regarding numerous facts about Dublin life and who responded in writing, thus actually producing *utterances* Joyce could have copied into his novel; and some, such as the Triestine publisher Teodore Mayer, whom Joyce knew and took as role models when it came to writing his characters into life. With respect to the second group, Joyce's biographer Richard Ellmann describes how Joyce was constantly hunting facts and observations for inclusion in his writing:
"Since the material of *Ulysses* was all human life, every man he met was an authority, and Joyce carried dozens of small slips of paper in his wallet and loose in his pockets to make small notes. When he had filled up the front and back of these, he continued to write on them diagonally. At home he would decipher his notes with a magnifying glass, a hint of what he had written being usually enough" (453).        
With respect to their representation in the network, then, the following question arose: how do I distinguish between "direct" influences, from whom Joyce solicited information, and these "indirect" influences, which Joyce encountered in his life and decided (maybe at some later point) to take as models for certain characters? An answer to this question also shapes the idea of authorship/agency underlying my model of a networked novel. 
My preliminary solution to this problem is based on already existing Joyce scholarship. Scholars like Ellmann seem to have a rather "loose" definition of authorship in Joyce's work, in spite of a clear bias for Joyce as the genius author. In a footnote to his acclaimed biography, which has been an immense help in supplying the necessary correspondents for this project, Ellmann writes of Irish writer George Moore: 
"It was fitting that Moore should wish to have written 'The Dead,' for in a sense he *had* written it, or at least had given Joyce an idea for its ending" (418, Fn.). 
It is this notion of authorship, then, that underlies my depiction of dispersed authorship in the production of *Ulysses*. This decision is informed by Joyce's own practice of taking facts from life for art as outlined by Ellmann. 
This theoretical decision also helps in determining the difference between my project and other online projects such as the website of the [Joyce Museum in Trieste](http://www.retecivica.trieste.it/joyce/default.asp?tabella_padre=sezioni&ids=3&tipo=blocchi_sezioni_3&pagina=-), which offers, among other things, a virtual tour of Joyce-related places and a list of people Joyce knew. The difference, as it is now defined, lies in the fact that my network will *only* include those people (and their respective addresses) who actually made a *contribution* to Joyce's novel (in the sense of contribution and agency outlined above). Moreover, in the descriptions of these contributors, I will attempt to highlight these contributions, and put the emphasis more on the people themselves, rather than on seeing them primarily as *Joyce's* contributors.

This decision also affects the visual content displayed in each info box. The initial idea was to find and display original images of the correspondence between Joyce and a particular contributor. This approach, however, only makes sense in the case of "direct" influences, where, moreover, the original correspondence is accessible/still in existence somewhere. In the case of "indirect" contributions, where no actual written exchange has taken place, I will therefore rely on other images (portraits, historical photographs, etc.). If no appropriate material is available, I will use a different template for the info boxes that does not include images.                 

##Dubliners and Constant Contributors

With the research phase thus completed for now (I have compiled about three notebook pages of names and functions of Joyce's contributors), it has become apparent that the initial decision to model three zones of the network (Trieste, Zürich, Paris) is problematic. 
* For one, this is because Joyce maintained communications with a few constant correspondents while living in these different locales. Technically, these people are part of all three networks, then, but it is difficult to represent this without producing double or triple entries in the data model/resulting map. 
* Second, given the "loose" idea of authorship I outlined above, role models for characters that Joyce saw in Dublin (and who imprinted themselves onto Joyce's mind until they were ripe for remembrance and inclusion in the novel) would have to be considered a part of the network as well: but where do I integrate those Dubliners in my three-pronged approach? 
* Third, the inability to contain any given network, then, has given me pause. I now regard it as impossible to map one (or many) constant network(s). This is due to the fact that contributors moved over time (and especially in the tumultuous years 1914-1922)—for instance Joyce's friend Nicolas Santos and his wife, who followed the Joyce family and moved from Trieste to Zürich ater the war broke out. Furthermore, given the existence of contributors as far away as Dublin and even America, Joyce's network was never contained to one locale at a certain time anyway. 

So how do I solve this conundrum? 

##The Author Node      
While it is true that his correspondents and friends moved around a lot, nobody seems to have moved quite as much as Joyce himself. For instance, he informed John Quinn that the flat at 9 rue de l'Universite was "the twentieth address" at which he had written Ulysses. 
So does that still make the author node representable? It is certainly not the calm center around which all the other addresses and people revolve. But I am inclined to think that this can be turned into an advantage: maybe all these addresses will visually convey an idea of the uncertainty and instability of Joyce's life during those years. So I have decided to include as many of the addresses of places where Joyce and his family lived between 1914 and 1922. These places will form the author node, which is its own layer in my map of the network, and can thus be turned on and off deliberately, blocking or including the author in the network that led to his novel. 

##Role model

I have identified a model for how I want to present my map online in [Mapping John Glassco's Memoirs of Montparnasse](http://aelang.net/projects/glassco.htm). This project maps all the figures in Glassco's memoir, people like Hemingway, Stein, and even Joyce himself. What particularly attracts me in this presentation is that it is 
* based on a Google spreadsheet, which is made public (an idea I want to follow in order to ensure the interoperability of my project), and
* embeds the resulting Google Maps into a webpage with its own mask, which allows for easy navigation via the page's design/filters.
