#Zaqir's Log 
####March 18th  


At this point, my main concern is to try and get all the audio to [Mitch Renaud](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/Logs/Renaudm1log040313.md) so that he can continue building his sound models for the exhibit.

In addition, the metadata for the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmC4guPyb1GedHB0NnBGQmZUbkVxczJ1X1lOTHdfMlE#gid=0) needs to be completed 

###Checklist

- there are 24 files currently in the dropbox; add the additional sounds.

- metadata in the spreadhseet needs to be finished off, transferred from workbook to the proper spreadsheet, etc.

- final scan of excerpts to make sure nothing overt has been missed in terms of sound

- send geo's for audio files to [Alex Christie](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/Logs/christieLog.md)

- get xml sheets for [David Carlton](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/Logs/CarltonLog01272013.md)
