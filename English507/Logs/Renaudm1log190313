## Kinect Demo

On Friday March 15th Gabrielle Odowichuk and I tested the range capabilities of a xBox Kinect in the gallery space. By mounting the Kinects on the rigging for the lights we can cover the two rows of panels with two kinects. There are range problems but they should be able to be solved by coding a new application that focuses more on location of bodies than their kinetic motions.

Pictures coming!

## Some Decisions 

1 - File organization within max patch
  I've decided to categorize the audio files in four registers of activity: short 		
	sounds, voices, music, ambiant sounds. The four registers are differentiated by file 
	length so there wont be distracting blips of sound coming on and off but rather a 
	constant flow of audio blending from registar to registar as well as from site to 
	site.
  
2 - Audio Sites
	I've decided on using either 17 speakers with limited directionality or 8 speakers 	
	(still with limited directionality) with more detailed panning to seperate the site. 	
	These 17 sites correspond with the sections of the novel displayed on the 17 panels. 
	The more speakers that are used the quiter it can be. The Kinects recognize when 
	someone is standing infront of a panel and fade that audio flow in. The volume of each 
	site is low enough that the audience has to "lean into the sound." By keeping the 
	speakers fairly uni-directional and thte levels low the instillation shouldn't 
	dominate the experiance of the audience member; let alone anyone in the adjcent spaces 
	of the library.
	
3 - Designation of labour
	Gab has volenteered to collaberate on the visual input side of things and will write a 
	program that captures the kinect data and send it to the max patch, which I will 
	create.
	
## Remaining Questions
	
1 - How to mount the two kinects?
2 - How to mount the speakers?
3 - Where to hide the computer? The goal is to have all components of the instillation as 
invisible as possible.
