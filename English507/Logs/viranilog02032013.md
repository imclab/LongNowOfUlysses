#Zaqir's Log 
#####(retroactive of March 2) 

I've been keeping a workbook for the last few weeks, so I'm commiting a few transcriptions retroactively, based on my notes.

Over the last few weeks I've been going through the motions of procuring audio samples, and the bulk of the work has been pretty straightforward. Out-of-copyright audio has been the easiest, by far. When available, I've just been taking .flac rips or mp3 files from CD's, but I came into a snag with copyrighted material.

The majority of the tracks from film scores and modern concept albums are under standard copyright, and a few are even under specialized copyright, involving licensing and package buying. 

My loophole:
fair-use previews. Sites like Amazon and Itunes provide a generally 26 second clip of a copyrighted audio track to preview before purchase, so I can feasibly employ the same method. 

The question is:

- do I simply point to these previews? This seems like it would defeat the whole "archive" aspect of this audio archive. 

- is there a way I can archive the preview?
