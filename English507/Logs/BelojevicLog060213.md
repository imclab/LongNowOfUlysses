Over the last few days I've mainly been familiarizing myself with design best practices, going through tutorials, and thinking about how the wireframe mockups should look. Following the meeting Jon and I had on Monday, I sketched out some key wireframes on paper yesterday:

The next step will be to build all the key wireframes in Balsamiq. We are both working through this right now and will reconnect in the next couple of days to determine what consistent elements we will want (header, footer, button types, etc.) before we then split the work between the two of us.
