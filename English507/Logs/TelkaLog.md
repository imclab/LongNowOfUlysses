Late start to log entries. Here's a brief summary of my work to date. 

##Planning

I created a gantt chart in Excle to structure and manage my project. I add components to the chart as the need emerges, and oftentimes alter deadlines to reflect the changing scope. 

I reviewed several resources (including NINCH guide, ORLANDO help guide, and the [Canadian Cultural Heritage Information Network](http://www.rcip-chin.gc.ca/index-eng.jsp) to inform the structural and rhetorical model for documentation or process narrative papers. 
 
The Canadian Cultural Heritage network provides several helpful resources from a curatorial perspective. [Conservation strategies for modern and contemporary art](http://www.inside-installations.org/OCMT/mydocs/HUMMELEN%20Conservation%20Strategies%20for%20Modern%20and%20Contemporary%20Art_1.pdf) offered some theoretical and methodological context while [Documenting Installation Art: A Collaboration Between S.M.A.K and TATE](9http://www.inside-installations.org/OCMT/mydocs/Document%20structure%20by%20TATE%20and%20S.M.A.K..pdf) provided some structural and methodological insight (in particular, we might consider using their data model map inventory, exhibition datasheet, and Documentation Master Check Sheet). 
 
THe [NINCH guide](http://www.nyu.edu/its/pubs/pdfs/NINCH_Guide_to_Good_Practice.pdf) was particularly informative as a formal model. To apply the formal elements of the NINCH Guide into my project, I identified the purpose of each section (preface, introduction, acknowledgements, etc.). Identifying the purpose of each section provided a structural blueprint for my doc. Once I knew what each section was meant to do, adding the content was a breeze. 

After the whirl-wind 507 workshop, I found ["Curating the MLA 2012 'Electronic Literature' Exhibit"](http://www.rhizomes.net/issue24/grigar.html). This essay provided me with some more generic structures, rhetorical models, and lit exhibit vocabularies. 

##Composition
I submitted the first draft into GitHub iteration one repo. It includes a preface, an intro, and a basic structure for the individual project components. 

Since that submission, I pillaged the repo for revised Needs Assessments and workflow documentation for exhbit components. So far, I've drafted descriptions for 9 projects. Each component incudes:
* Project Description
* Justification/critical framework
* Purpose Statement
* Deliverable
* Workflow Documentation

I've also been working on a glossary to add as an appendix. It's basically a DH glossary and it will provide discipline-specific context for folks new to DH, digital curation and conseration, and digital technologies in general.

Looking ahead to this week, I'll be polishing these statements, reviewing workflow documentation, and revising the introduction in response to Bethany Nowviski's suggestion to position the exhibit as student scholarship. Her advise impacts how I style the how-to manual (an invitation for peer-review will be the primary aim while replicating our process might take a second seat). I also need to incorporate critical framework into the intro (eg- DH principles, curation and preservation, literary exhibits, at stake statements, student scholarship, humanities, libraries, and cultural heritage collaborations...)

I need to locate a visualization tool to render workflow data (among other things) into meaningful images (I'll use Inspirations to concept map at least one or two projects but some graphs, maps, and trees would be cools too). Any suggestions would be appreciated. 

I need to meet with JS to plan next phase (visualization, finding aid, exhibit curation statement).

I need Alicia's iteration one....it wasn't in the repo. 

I need help interpreting Mitch's first iteration. Whoa! 

I need to list and link resources for each project. 

I need to figure out peer-review process for next iteration. 

I'm considering adding a floor map or blueprint of the Maltwood Gallery to provide spacial context for exhibit. It would also add cool visual interest to my doc. 

##Publication

Still trying to imagine the best way to get this project out there. It would be great to start planning (if this hasn't already happened) infrastructure for digital exhibit space (like DC was talking about). Is there room for printing and binding a few copies of this doc for the exhibit space?
