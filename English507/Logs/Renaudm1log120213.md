## Other Possible Sounds

I've been thinking about musical works written, revised, or premiered in 1904 or 1922 that are staples of modernist composition of the time. I've been thinking about this sound source as playing into a long now of modernism in general. From these works I could look to later music that has been influenced by Joyce from composers such as Boulez, Berio, or Cage.

I am hesitant whether I want to depart from the novel or not. Especially with a line of thought that could easily grow to over shadow the sounds from the novel.

## Sample from the complete works of Webern:

Revised in 1922:
Four Lieder Op. 13 4. Ein Winterabend

Composed in 1922:
Five Sacred Songs Op. 15 2. Morgenlied
Five Sacred Songs Op. 15 4. Mein Weg geht jetzt vorüber

There are no surviving works from Webern written in 1904. His first Opus numbered piece is from 1908.

## Music within Ulysses

"Molly Bloom, one of Ulysses’s main characters, is a professional soprano, and an entire chapter of Ulysses, known as ‘Sirens’, takes music as its subject and style -- Joyce claimed he wrote it in the form of a fuga per canonem. 

Important moments throughout the novels are related in musical terms: in Chapter 4 of A Portrait, when Stephen Dedalus finds his calling as an artist, it is heralded by his hearing imaginary music that is described in some technical detail, 2 while in the climactic Circe chapter in Ulysses, a pianola and gramophone appear behind much of the action, and Joyce has Stephen pick out an octave on the piano as a symbol of returning home after an odyssey. 3 Joyce even writes in a few bars of actual musical scores in three places in his work -- a fragment of plainchant (9.499) and two fragments of a ballad in Ulysses (17.808-828) and what Joyce calls "The Ballad of Persse O’Reilly" in Finnegans Wake. 4 Allusions to music -- popular song and opera -- are everywhere. The first attempt to categorize these allusions, Song in the Works of James Joyce, by Matthew J. C. Hodgart and Mabel P. Worthington (New York: Columbia University Press, 1959) contained 3,500 allusions, and the authors apologized for its lack of completeness."

## Title Thoughts

"Sounding Ephemera from Ulysses" Or something that plays with the idea of the inherent ephemeral nature of sound and the tensions/ideas that arise from encryption and re-diffusion.
