# HyperLit Log - 11 March 2013

Jon and I spent a very exciting Saturday at Games Without Frontiers. It was great to share our HyperLit idea with so many people, and we received really positive responses.

Here's a photo of our demo space:

The feedback we received during our 507 session last week was really helpful, and we made some changes to our wireframes prior to Saturday. Here's a link to the wireframes we presented at the event: https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/Logs/HyperLitPresentation.pptx

Oh, and we were mentioned in the Time Colonist: http://www.timescolonist.com/news/local/the-positive-side-of-video-games-explored-at-ideafest-1.88073
