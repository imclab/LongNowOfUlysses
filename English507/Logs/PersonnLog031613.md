##Explorations with Exhibit

In order to refine the view of my entries I have activated the "lens" function in Exhibit 3.0. Lenses in Exhibit are templates for how I want a certain entry to look. They allow you to display certain descriptors but suppress others; thus, by adding a bit of code to my HTML file, I am able to display only the name of the place where Joyce presumably interacted with a certain person, and the name of that person. The resulting lens view differs slightly from the uncategorized view I presented before:

This view is superior because it only exhibits information on the actual interaction in the network and suppresses Exhibit-related information like Latitude/longitude, the urls where data can be found, etc. 
An alternative view is Exhibit's tabular view, which is basically a normal table, although Exhibit does give the user the ability to sort the table by clicking on the columns headings. By manipulating the HTML file, I arrive at the following display of three parameters from my Network data (label, network, and person; here represented as Where?, Network, and Who?):

Both these views, however, are still only relatively uninformative lists that do not "tell a story" or help locate such a narrative in time and space. After all, it is one of the characteristic features of a story to have a temporal and spatial dimension that allow for an understanding of the story's causality. Hence the next challenge will be to add temporality and spatiality to the exhibit view. Exhibit offers two extensions to enable such views: the Timeline extension and the Map View extension. These extensions are not automatically available in Exhibit and need to be specified as extensions at the top of the HTML file. Unfortunately, upon a few first attempts I have been unable to mobilize these extensions to add a timeline and a map to my exhibit. Using a [CAR 2012 tutorial](http://people.csail.mit.edu/karger/Exhibit/CAR/HandsOn), I will keep trying to do so during my next steps. Two possible mistakes might be connected with 
* a. a wrong or misleading Google API key in my code, or 
* b. a use of code that refers to extensions in Exhibit 2.0 which is incompatible with Exhibit 3.0.
