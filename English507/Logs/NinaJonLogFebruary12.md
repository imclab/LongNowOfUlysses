#DataModelling 
 
Over the weekend we created about a dozen wireframes in Balsamiq. The idea was to create all of the essential elements of the website that the user would encounter, and to showcase the prospective features of the application itself. After compiling our data, we arranged the mockups as they would appear to the user in PNG in the form of how the user would experience the site itself. We have been sharing our data via Dropbox, and have decided to model our data by exporting each individual mockup/wireframe into xml, and pasting each xml document into a Numbers Spreadsheet (with each mockup, of course, being labelled and arranged as per the site layout). 

Currently we have a SignIn Screen, Home/NewsFeed Screen, Calendar and Calendar Modification Screen, Reading Screen (fullpage and lite version), Reading Summary Screens (daily, weekly, all time), and FeedBack Screen.

The site is currently arranged as follows. Click on each link to see a png image of the selected screen.
