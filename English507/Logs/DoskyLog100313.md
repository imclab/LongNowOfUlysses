Recently I have tapped into a couple lists -MSA and *Ulysses* reading list - received some responses

Responses range from being thoughtful scholarly readings to free associations with aspects of contemporary culture, or even respondents' personal lives.

Thinking about Manovich's "suites of visualization": I am interested in all the contributions, I think that there is value in both types, but I also think it would be useful to break things down a little bit further and provide viewers with different ways of visualizing the annotations. 

I would like to find a way to filter or layer my visualization so that people who visit the timeline have the option to view what have been deemed critical and potentially useful annotations (from the perspective of a humanities scholar). If all of the critically informed annotations can be grouped together, debates might emerge surrounding the significance of particular terms or sections of the excerpts (people often seize upon the same word in their annotations). There is also the possibility of new knowledge being generated - someone might hit on something that was not considered before - I think this is especially likely because the close reading that I asked people to do is only based on a preview and makes the text new again.

Other annotations that are a result of free association could be viewed separately as well. They provide the type of information that Manovich calls "situational awareness." These annotations might be interesting to a different type of scholar, maybe one conducting a cultural study on contemporary modes of reading. It might even be interesting for viewers to be able to see the ratio of types of responses I have received.
