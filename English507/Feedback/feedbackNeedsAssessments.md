# Feedback on Needs Assessments 

## AlH

(in response to [this document](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/NeedsAssessment/74656NeedsAssessment.md))

Thanks for your needs assessment. I enjoyed reading it, and I particularly like the title. After reviewing the assessment several times, I'm wondering if some of the basics could be unpacked here, if only to further investigate feasibility issues (beyond funding and other forms of support). And so, with the basics in mind, here are some some questions for you: 

* How could the project description be more precise, especially for audiences who are unfamiliar with the topic, the long now, and terms such as "CubeSate" and "Pioneer Plaque"? 
* Who exactly will this project benefit, and how? 
* If you were to justify the selection of *Ulysses* as *the* novel for outer space, then what would be the justification? Or, if *Ulysses* scholars were to justify its selection, then what would be their claim? (I ask this question because such a justification might benefit the project description.) 
* What's the workflow for the plaque? Can you give audiences a more specific sense of what it will include, how it will be made, and why? 

As I mentioned at other moments, I think this project would be great even if the final product (for the semester) is a working prototype or proof of concept. And given statements like this one on the [CubeSat website](http://www.cubesatkit.com/content/design.html) --- "you may export these models and the data they represent to Rapid Prototyping (RP) machines in order to create models of CubeSat Kit components for the purpose of either prototyping designs that will use CubeSat Kit components or displaying RP'd CubeSat Kit components in order to obtain funding for CubeSat programs" --- we could likely fabricate a plastic version of the cube for display or other purposes.  

Consequently, I encourage you to work toward these goals: 

* A persuasive rationale for the selection of *Ulysses* (here, you might consult with me, Stephen Ross, and/or folks in the 560 and 507); 
* A prototype of the "etched" plaque itself (ideally, it would be a physical object, but a digital prototype will suffice); 
* A written justification for what goes on the plaque (e.g., some/all of the novel, an image of Joyce, or a graphic representation of the novel), accompanied by a bib; 
* A printed replica of the cube, based on a model in STL format (I can help you here); 
* An assembly document; and 
* A one-page "pitch" (or the like) for why the project should be realized, by whom, and with what implications. In this case, your prototype would be used to make the argument that *Ulysses* should actually be launched into space. (If you wish, then the pitch could be a video instead of a written document.)   

I think these goals are achievable by the semester's end, but let me know if you think we should trim them back a bit. For instance, we could cut the replica and the assembly document, if need be. 

Get in touch with questions, and thanks again for a wonderful idea!

P.S.: You might touch base with DC about his encoding project. Perhaps some worthwhile overlaps there?

(in response to [this document](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/NeedsAssessment/CarltonNeeds.md)) 

Thanks for this top shelf needs assessment. It's precise, honest, and easy to follow. I really appreciate it, and I'm also persuaded by a number of gestures you make, including: "the textual backbone of the exhibit can be readily interrogated in a more abstract way, while still remaining eminently accessible to the general public." Elsewhere, you attend often and effectively to the material particulars of what you propose. For instance, here you're already aware of why browsers and default settings would affect your project's ultimate usability: "Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Google Chrome and Internet Explorer to gauge how well my marked-up texts render in each browser, and alter the scripts as necessary." 

As far as feasibility is concerned, I believe this bit will likely be your biggest challenge: "I will express my encodings in a close approximation of the same font and orientation as the scans, so as to preserve the aesthetic flavor of the static images, while also providing the flexibility of digital text." However, based on the example project you provide (thanks for that!), I don't have many concerns.

After you articulate your TEI schema (with help from me and perhaps others), I recommend periodically committing your XML and CSS files to our repo. In the LongNowOfUlysses directory, we should probably create a folder for this specific purpose. What do you think? 

Soon, I'll be asking everyone for a data model and sample data. In your case, the model will be your TEI P5 schema, and your data will be the excerpts, together with bibliographic information about the 1922 Shakespeare and Co. edition of *Ulysses*. Here, tho, you are already well on your way to producing such a model and its related data: "Using oXygen, I will mark-up the dates and times of the exhibit, the names of those involved, the bibliographical information of the original book from which the extracts have been taken, and a number of other prose-text related particulars, such as paragraph size, font, number of nouns/verbs/adjectives/vowels, etc.) to give an overall 'literary-aesthetic frame' of each extract as a textual object that's representative of the exhibit." 

Aside from questions about the schema (that we'll address as they emerge), my only other question for now is whether you've considered a URL. In short, where exactly will the project live and how will it be accessed? 

## LD

(in response to [this document](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/NeedsAssessment/DoskyNeedsAssessment.md)) 

Thanks for this great needs assessment, which demonstrates well how much you are thinking ahead. Since we've already chatted about your project quite a bit, I'll jump right into some questions and observations:

* How about drafting a public-facing project description, even if you know it will inevitably change? One consequence of this exercise will be more sustained thought on why you are doing what you are doing and for whom. Right now, I think the stakes of the project (or why it matters) could be increased a bit.  

* This comment won't surprise you, but I think the prompt is still pretty vague. Let's see how people respond. In the future, you might need to give people more direction, including things to look for and consider. I only say this because I get those sorts of requests quite often in response to my prompts. Plus, *Ulysses* is an unruly text, which can take people in a variety of directions. 

* In the next few weeks, I wonder if you could unpack and refine some of the terms and gestures from the Needs Assessment. For instance, what is a "critical track"? A "thoughtful annotation"? Or a meaningful contribution to this project? Doing so would also help you better articulate your goals or aims. Know what I mean? 

* Related to the previous point, I was struck by your comments on reading and interpreting in a "digital age." Are you familiar with recent literary studies work on attention and multitasking? If not, then I recommend "Hyper and Deep Attention: The Generational Divide in Cognitive Modes" by Katherine Hayles and Cathy Davidson's work at [HASTAC](http://hastac.org/blogs/cathy-davidson) and elsewhere (including [this piece](http://chronicle.com/article/Collaborative-Learning-for-the/128789/) in *The Chronicle*).  

* I see the plan in your timeline, but I'd love to hear more about how the rotating content will be integrated into the physical space. What will be the workflow? Who will decide what is selected? 

* As you gather information (e.g., via a spreadsheet), you might want to version it by making copies and renaming them. That way, you can track what changes over time.  

* Soon, I'll be asking everyone to produce a data model and some sample data. In your case, timeline.js has more or less already provided the model. And it appears as though you'll have sample data soon. Good stuff! 

* As far as the excerpts are concerned, I'd encourage you to think small. I don't really think you need to cover all the excerpts, and (more importantly) I'm not sure you have the time. Maybe pick the ones you think will be the most meaningful?  

I hope these observations and comments are of use. Let me know what other questions or concerns you have. At some point, we should also talk design here, including where and how the timeline will be embedded and even represented in print (e.g., as a panel in the exhibit). Thanks again! 

## ArH 

(in response to [this document](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/NeedsAssessment/HainNeeds.md)) 

Thanks for a really great needs assessment. I particularly appreciate your attention to detail, as well as the way in which your project description already speaks quite persuasively to an educated, non-expert audience beyond 507 and 560. Good stuff.

In terms of conceptualization, I'm also struck by how you manage to acknowledge the inability of "being there" while also giving a whirl at empathy, or identification, through Bloom Vision (which also makes for a smart title).  

For now, I only have a few comments and questions, largely because this assessment is so well done and your plan is most certainly feasible.  

* When you model the kit, you should (if it's not already obvious) model the parts, not the whole.  

* In late February, I'm running a "Hello World" workshop on stitching 2D into 3D. Perhaps you could attend it? Details soon.   

* As for the Freund collection, we'll need scans without digital watermarks. Have you chatted with the library about this possibility? I assume not. That said, remind Stephen and me what photograph(s) you'd like to request. We're sending our ask list to the UVic art collections soon. You could just pick something from the online collection? Or would you rather wait for 560's list (so you can get a better sense of coherence, narrative, or method)? 

* In the physical space of the exhibit, how do you imagine people using the stereoscope? Will it be tethered? If so, then to what?  

* As for rendering the photographs stereoscopic, could you photograph them (with an SLR) at different angles? I ask because of this comment: "I plan to scan, offset, and re-print two slightly different versions of a single image, but stereoscopic photography often involves a difference in angle (i.e. in the actual camera angle between the original images), not merely in position."

* The timeline looks great. Smart planning.   

* Let me know when you want to order the kit (if that's your ultimate route). 

Thanks again! I'm looking forward to watching this project unfold.  

P.S.: Soon, I'll be asking people to provide data models and sample data for their projects, In your case, you can use the 3D prototyping portion of your project for your model. More info soon. 

## JJ 

(in response to [this document](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/NeedsAssessment/JohnsonNeedsAssessment.md))

Thank you for this needs assessment, which is much more concrete, feasible, and concise than the initial articulation of your project. Good stuff! I'm also glad to see that you're focusing on the prototyping phase of the project, with hopes of furthering it into execution during, say, the DHSI. 

Below, then, is a list of things to consider (take them or leave them): 

* Could the description ultimately be revised and refined in order to appeal to a broader range of audiences (academic or not)? In so doing, you might also want to shorten it a bit (e.g., something comparable to your elevator speech for the project).   

* Comparable to the thought piece, parts of the description might be too ambitious for what you can achieve, especially when using Balsamiq. That said, how could you express some of the design features and specs through video? Or, to put it differently: what could video do that Balsamiq cannot? (I hope the example vid prototypes I circulated will help here. Let me know if you need more resources.) 

* What example projects exist that might influence your project? You mention a few related health and quantified self apps, but you might want to do a more thorough and systematic assessment of what's out there (including existing and missing features). See more below, where I ask about your critique of existing e-readers.  

* I would keep the vid short (30 seconds to 1 minute). If possible, then you'll want to touch base with possible actors soonish. I doubt you'll need too many people, and a chunk of the work will be concentrated in post-production.  

* When filming, I recommend shooting from multiple perspectives at once. The library should have some digital camcorders you can use. Let me know how else I can help here (resource-wise).  

* I love the "Games without Frontiers" angle. Smart! Also, during Congress, the [CGSA](http://playces.edu.yorku.ca/) is meeting. They might be interested in what you're doing.  

* If you want audio in your video prototype, then you can also include headphones in the exhibit. Your choice. (I can see the benefits of a silent prototype, tho, especially in a moment when silent film is having a renaissance. The talkies weren't a thing in 1904, either.) 
  
* I like the use of web comics. Good idea. But again, you might want to identify what can be cut from the project should you face time and resource constraints.   

* During the semester, you'll want to unpack your critique of Kobo and Kindle a bit, making it more precise and poignant. Identifying what material particulars each is lacking will make your project all the more persuasive.  

* Soon, I'll be asking for a data model for each project. In your case, that can be a wireframe based in a Balsamiq prototype, together with some key features of your app. In other words: your data model will be a design model. However, you are also welcome to identify how your app will or would tap into the Google Calendar API, which is another way to structure data.  

* Wait . . . reading literature isn't fun? 

* In the future, in markdown you can just use asterisks to create line items (e.g., in the deadlines and milestones section of your needs assessment). See the raw text of this document for examples.  

* Mind explaining how InDesign would figure in? Or let me know what you're considering web-wise. I'm happy to help.  

* As for your DHSI plans, I could contact Andy and Matt, if you want. Give them a heads up, and help you plan accordingly? Let me know if this option appeals.  

Thanks again! This is a great start to a clever project.  

## MR

(in response to [this document](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/NeedsAssessment/Renaudm1NeedsAssessment.md))

Thanks for this needs assessment, which details a project I believe will really enhance the exhibit experience, not to mention the collective interpretation of *Ulysses*. As you mention on various occasions in the assessment, you are still working through the particulars here, and I hope the questions and comments below will help you proceed: 

* As you revise, you might consider a more persuasive title, as well as a more concrete project description that gives a wide range of audiences a specific sense of what you're doing and why.  

* Do you have Max/MSP on your desktop or laptop? If not, then you might consider the trial version. There are also educational licenses. Let me know if you need more advice here. 

* By extension, what's your experience with Max/MSP? You say you could use some help troubleshooting, but I'd love to hear more about when and how you've used it in the past.

* Also, you might consider finding some relevant patches online, and then testing them. Try [Max Objects](http://maxobjects.com/) and GitHub. You might also consider [Maxuino](http://playground.arduino.cc/interfacing/MaxMSP) for this project. I'm happy to chat more about microcontroller possibilities.  

* Perhaps the most important and pressing question here is: What's in the sound library? What (kinds of) sounds are you working with and why? How do they intersect with *Ulysses* and the long now? In making these decisions, you might want to consult with ZV. But the selection of sounds is key.  

* In the future, in markdown you can just use asterisks to create line items (e.g., in the bibliography section of your needs assessment). See the raw text of this document for examples.  

* For what it's worth, I love the idea of an audible paste.  

* You write: "A risk is the 'known unknowns; that can’t/won’t arise until the piece is installed in the space and an audience comes through." But, from experience, we can anticipate some issues, right? After all, this is precisely what interaction designers do. So what are some of those issues? What surprises or complications are most likely? When testing, what physical space and design issues do we need to consider? 

* How do you plan to document your work this semester? For instance, how will you note what patches you've tried, what worked, and what didn't? Consider a log here. You could also commit it regularly to the repo.   

* When you say you "need the school to provide some of the materials," to what school are you referring? Are you referring to folks in music here? Apologies. I'm not very familiar with UVic Fine Arts protocols.   

* In terms of materials, I wonder if you need a camera or if sensors (e.g., infrared) would be better. Let's chat on that front.   

* As for reading, I believe [Tom Igoe's work](http://tigoe.net/pcomp/index.php) might be the most relevant here. Are you already familiar with his research? 

Looking forward to chatting more about the details. Thanks again!

Thanks for your needs assessment! I enjoyed reading it. Since it's quite similar to JJ's, I'll refer you to [my feedback above](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/Feedback/feedbackNeedsAssessments.md#JJ). 

I should also add that the articulation of your goals is quite persuasive, especially the first personal goal. Good stuff!  

Looking forward to working with you this semester! 

## AC

(in response to [this document](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/NeedsAssessment/christieNeedsAssessment.md)) 

Thanks for this needs assessment. I like where it's going, and I appreciate the insistence on shared workflows and collaborative knowledge production, which few people in this seminar are taking seriously.  

Resonating with my previous comments on this project, I think we're still a bit blue sky here. There's a lot going on, without much specificity in terms of mission or workflow. That said, below are some questions and observations to consider: 

* As you revise, the project description might be a bit more public-facing, with a larger audience (of both academics and non-academics) in mind. It could also be shorter and more concise.  

* If you want to stick with these three lines of inquiry, then I recommend sticking to a single platform, data model, and workflow. That way, you can layer the research in an app like Google Earth. And your data could be structured in something like CSV or XML (which could be generated through a Google Spreadsheet). Then you would have a more precise workflow, which is largely missing here.  

* I'm still not sure why geospatial expression is necessary for aspect 1 (afterlives) of the project. Aspect 2 seems the most promising for geospatial work, and aspect 3 could be thought-provoking, especially if the historical maps are stretched or warped onto a base layer, through a shared platform. (I'm happy to help you.) 

* Echoing some of my comments here, I wonder if you can refine the research and articulate how these three trajectories are motivated by, say, a shared question, method, or investment. Central to this refinement will be an actual, expressed need for a map (beyond whiz bang or neato factors).  

* Stay away from Flash. I speak from [experience](http://www.jenterysayers.com/2010/213/).  

* I agree, and this is a big risk: "The largest risk is that the three segments of our group’s map will not be interoperable." 

* When writing in markdown, you can use an asterisk to create a line item. I see that a lot of your sections (e.g., "Timeline") seem like lists but are not expressed as such. See the raw for this document, if you want markdown examples.  

* On the topic of doing too much, are you being overzealous here?: "Successfully prototyping and delivering a product that uses interface to levarage arguments about media archaeology, network archaeology, the temporal experience of geography, and the historical and political contexts for transnational literature would fulfill this goal." 

I'm looking forward to working with you on this project. As your group proceeds toward your data model, my suggestion is to focus on a single platform, talk with me about feasibility and workflow issues, and do what you can to refine the inquiry. Whenever possible, think small. Thanks!

## AmH

(in response to [this document](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/NeedsAssessment/hansenNeeds.md)) 

Thanks for this needs assessment. I'm glad to see you collaborating with other people in 507, especially since such collaborations have not exactly been common in the seminar thus far (at least).  

Comparable to [my comments above](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/Feedback/feedbackNeedsAssessments.md#AC), I'm wondering how you might refine the inquiry a bit here. While I think this is a persuasive start, I don't want you to commit to too much, either. So, with thinking small in mind, below are my comments and questions: 

* As you revise, you'll likely want to unpack the project description a bit, with a broad audience in mind. Feel free to justify and explain your project, where necessary. 

* I can see where you are going with the geospatial angle, but I wonder if you could further rationalize it. What about this research warrants a map? What will a map tell us that other modes cannot or do not? And will you ultimately be re-presenting (or re-structuring) existing information? If so, then how will that representation spark new lines of inquiry and interpretations of *Ulysses* (in particular) or modernism (in general)? Of note, you might check out Drucker's ["Humanistic Theory and Digital Scholarship"](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/34), especially the closing few gestures.  

* Stay away from Flash. I speak from [experience](http://www.jenterysayers.com/2010/213/). It's difficult to learn, and it's not interoperable. In my opinion, it's being replaced by HTML5, to boot.  

* Of note, you can build time and narrative into a Google map or into Google Earth. See me for a data model. The perk to this approach is that you could export your data (as XML), and you could also screencast a narrative through either platform (giving you video, without using Flash). Google Earth affords narrative "paths" through geotemporal content. 

* Perhaps you could focus on something even more specific?  "I will attempt to limit my mapping to what I would consider to be major points -- translations, stage and film adaptations, festivals, etc." 

* Related to the last question, how about a map of time-stamped translations? Or a map of stage adaptations? I ask these questions because I'm somewhat concerned that you won't have enough time to gather robust data.  

* Finally, what is your workflow for gathering this data?: "A data set that chronicles the translations, versions, and adaptations of Ulysses, as well as major journals, festivals, and events that were/are inspired by Ulysses." 

I love this idea. Now the question is what's feasible between now and March's end. Could you focus on a particular medium or form of adaptation / translation?  

Thanks again! I'm looking forward to working with you this semester.  

## MJ

(in response to [this document](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/NeedsAssessment/jacobsenNeeds.md))

Thanks for this need assessment! Echoing our discussions last week, I really like where the project is going, particularly its emphasis on digital/material convergence and intermedia (or transmedia).  

The project description is well written, and I think the list of references makes sense for this inquiry. To the list, I might add Drucker's [*Graphic Design History*](http://books.google.ca/books/about/Graphic_design_history.html?id=qBgRAQAAMAAJ) as well as some materials on the attention economy (see below).  

As we've discussed, the key here will be articulating a technique and method, which can be mobilized through *Ulysses* as a "tutor text" of sorts. For instance, how would print physically change if we mapped web-based reading practices onto its production? This kind of question privileges the digital as a way of reading, an embodied phenomenology steeped in culture, habits, and assumptions.   

And historically, print has been terrible at yielding usage data. Right? Beyond units sold, we cannot determine who is reading what. On the contrary, the web affords a robust attention economy, giving advertisers, designers, content developers, and the like opportunities to track pageviews, bounce rates, discussions, and cross-site references. In short, reading becomes productive of value; it generates followers, revenue, and traffic. And it is welded to data histories, which can always be refreshed or revisited (or rendered "undead"). [Beller's work](http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/24/beller.php) is informative here: "That humanity, whether dancing and wailing on our screens, repressed beyond their frames, or stammering in our heads is the specter haunting the society of the spectacle—in the world of paying attention, humanity has become its own ghost."  

Again, echoing Friday's chat, what if you pulled a medium swap here? What if you took what you can learn about usage statistics and the attention economy of the web and remediated a print selection of *Ulysses* accordingly? What would that new materialism say about contemporary reading practices? About the web? About print? About "difficult" novels? 

Let me know how it's going, and how I can help. Thanks! 

## TP 

(in response to [this document](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/NeedsAssessment/personnNeeds.md))

Great work, and an enjoyable read. I'm especially struck by how much this assessment is informed by data modelling, especially the "Timeline" section. And generally speaking, I think this is a fantastic idea: "Hence Networked Ulysses aims to arrive at a visualization that de-centres the authorial figure and highlights the role of Joyce's resources and collaborators." Below, then, I just have a few comments and questions, all based on the assumption that a KML file (intended for Google Maps and Earth) is the way to go here: 

* Remember that, for Latour, the local more or less determines the global. How does that claim resonate (if at all) with your mission here? How would it shape your decision on what actants to include in your map?  

* We could just ORC them? I recommend scanning / photographing them when we come across them, tho. Perhaps there is a repo of existing materials somewhere? Stephen might know. "It would be ideal to have scans of the responses (postcards, letters) that led Joyce to include certain facts/descriptions in the novel. These scans would also have to be transcribed for improved readability." 

* THANK YOU. "In order to limit a possibly limitless gaze, then, the exhibit will indicate the extension of the Long Now in which Joyce's work took shape by choosing a small number of physical addresses for each European city involved."

* Wonderfully modelled, smart stuff: "So there will be a Trieste network, a Zurich network, and a Paris network, each taking up Joyce's presence in the respective city and mapping his contacts across Europe at the time." 

* Agreed: "This difficulty of unearthing original responses indicates how Networked Ulysses goes against the grain of Joyce/*Ulysses* scholarship, which, by and large, has been more interested in the author than in his respondents." 

* When writing in markdown, feel free to use an asterisk for line items. For instance, the first paragraph of your timeline section appears to be a list but is not expressed that way. See the raw of this file for examples.   

* We'll see. The easiest route will likely be an index of all the exhibit's web-based components. "In order for the final maps to be presented online and linked to a central page, we will presumably need web space."

* If you are curious about Latour and Haraway, then I recommend Wolfgang Ernst's *Digital Memory and the Archive*. (Maybe reading for the summer?) 

I've got a great data model for working with Google Maps and Earth, and I think it would work for this project. Let me know if you want to give it a try. Thanks!

Thanks for this needs assessment. It's full of great stuff and smart ideas. Given the overlaps, I recommend reading my comments on [AC's NA](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/Feedback/feedbackNeedsAssessments.md#AC), too. Other than the questions and concerns articulated there, here are few more things to consider: 

* This bit did not come up during our conversation the other day, but I'm intrigued and would love to hear more: "To determine this proportional relation, the number of total words in the novel are divided by the number of words anchored in a specific area of Dublin." Sounds like a great idea! 

* Stay away from Flash. I speak from [experience](http://www.jenterysayers.com/2010/213/). It's difficult to learn, and it's not interoperable. In my opinion, it's being replaced by HTML5, to boot.  

* Again, this is intriguing. You might find Gifford's annotations of use. What would you do, tho, when location is vague or difficult to geostamp? "A chart of the journey in Ulysses, the total words count in the 1922 edition, a division of the novel based on place and a calculation of words locatable in each place-based segment or a detailed timeline of the novel's movement through Dublin."

* I would avoid this by using KML, Google Maps, and Google Earth: "The primary constraint is time in terms of learning Hypercities, setting up an account, and learning how to convert Flash into HTML5 or learning a new program for animating a map."

* Related to my previous point, you might also read my comments on [AmH's NA](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/Feedback/feedbackNeedsAssessments.md#AmH).

* I have a data model that might be of use to your group. Let me know if you're interested. You could use it to geotag aspects of *Ulysses*. And you could also add historical maps to Google's base, with "zones" of interest and interpretation layered on top. No need for Flash or the like.  

* Not a problem. We'll probably just make a simple index of all the exhibit's web-based components: "The group may also need a few pages (a page for each mapping project) on the exhibit site if this is possible and ammenable to the online component of the exhibit." 

On the building front, let's touch base soon about next steps. Looking forward! 

## ZV

(in response to [this document](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/NeedsAssessment/viraniNeeds.md)) 

Thanks for this needs assessment, which I enjoyed reading. I love the title, too. For now, I just have a few comments and questions: 

* In the description, you might want to further unpack why studying sound is appropriate for *Ulysses*. This decision is likely obvious to many people who are familiar with the novel; however, the unfamiliar might need an example or two.  

* As you proceed, you'll probably want to address technique and method more directly. For instance, how are you identifying "loudness" in the text? "In a critical attempt to explore and interpret the overlapping sounds of the episodes, a selection of the archived content will be spliced and edited together in the attempt to recreate some of the... 'louder' moments in Ulysses."  

* Have you looked into the specs of Adlib? It's new to me, and it looks somewhat involved, especially in terms of cyberinfrastructure.  

* Have you considered SoundCloud? A number of academic projects have started using it, including [soundBox](http://sites.fhi.duke.edu/soundbox/2012/09/05/sounding-out-digital-humanities/).  

* You might also consider Scalar, if it piques your interest. Here's [an example](http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/pieces/writing-sound) of how you can use it for audio. In fact, you can slurp SoundCloud files into it for interpretive purposes.   

* As for materials, have you come across [Ubu on Joyce](http://www.ubu.com/sound/joyce.html)? 

* In the writing, you might be careful with your use of "archive," which means something very specific to archivists and information professionals. Perhaps, for your project, "collection" or "repo" is more appropriate?  

* Here, perhaps fair dealing would apply? We should confirm: "Material from the films or plays or albums, however, could prove difficult. I am currently unsure how to navigate this, as I am almost sure it will come up." 

* How do you imagine the audio being accessed in the exhibit space? You mentioned some specifics, but I'd like to hear more. For instance, would you actually need a monitor or visual interface? 

Generally speaking, at some point soon we should talk more about the tech specs for your project, including what exactly you want your project to do and how. Sound good? Looking forward!

(in response to [this document](https://github.com/Telka/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/NeedsAssessment/TelkaNeeds%20Assessment%20Log.md)) 

Thanks a bunch for this assessment. I really like where it's going, and I'm so glad someone in the seminar has taken up the challenge of translating our process for public audiences and producing documentation accordingly. As you'll notice, I don't have too many questions or comments for now, and most of them are about the structure of the process document itself. Please let me know what questions or concerns you have! Thanks! 

Questions and comments:  

* As you proceed, the project description will likely need to be revised and written in the present tense. That way, it can speak to people who might encounter your component of the exhibit for the first time, without much familiarity. Make sense? 

* During the next few weeks, I'd be interested in hearing more about this bit: "These entries will be revised with interoperability, and pedagogical applications in mind." I'm wondering how you might be more precise, especially when it comes to pedagogical applications and learning opportunities.   

* I love the idea of using the NINCH guide as a model. Perhaps you could look to it for structure, too? As you already mentioned, poaching their use of "link boxes" might be smart as well.  

* Have you considered video for any of the guide? Where might it be useful (if at all) when documenting and communicating tacit knowledge? On this front, you might talk to ArH, who is well-versed in producing vid of workshops and such.  

* I'd be interested in hearing more about the structure of the document: what are the key components or sections? How are you organizing the material, using what rationale? How will the structure make our process more familiar to outsiders? In the last instance, who are the key target audiences? 

* Finally, to what degree will other people in the class contribute to the document (aside from what they are already contributing to the repo)?

Thanks again!
