## Working Title: 

"Sounding Ulysses"

## Project Description:

"Sounding Ulysses" works to create an interactive environment where exhibit goers play a part in the sonic dimension of the space. The piece takes sounds related to the surrounding panels and deploys them through a system that reacts to the audience. The sounds can be readings of dialog, soundscapes, music referenced, etc. The way the sounds are deployed depends on how the audience interacts with the exhibit – whether they intend to or not. Active interaction happens through manipulation of a portion of the exhibit to alter the diffusion of sounds. Passive interaction occurs through the audience’s movement through the space as well as the level of their conversation.

## Materials:

* Computer with capability to run Max/MSP runtime
* Soundcard with capability to output the number of channels used in the exhibit.
* Speaker Rig: 8-channel, 4 channel, or stereo. (headphones would be depressing)
* Material for speaker instillation (stands or mounts).
* Relavent Cables
* Webcam(s?) and appropriate interfaces
* Sound samples for patch database: Historical, dramatized text, soundscape, music 
* To be determined tactile way of interaction...

## Project Definition and Scope:

The patch will have two ways that audience members can interact: Actively, where they manipulate some material objects (I am still fleshing this part out). Passive interaction reacts to the way the audience moves within the space as well as the level of their conversation. The patch will draw on a database of sounds selected from the chosen excepts (one per excerpt).

## Project Delivery:

My project will deliver an interactive Max/MSP environment along with a database of sounds that the patch draws on for material.

## Risks and Constraints:

What the library allows me to do and the materials available will shape how my project grows. A risk is the “known unknowns” that can’t/won’t arise until the piece is installed in the space and an audience comes through.

## Project Benefit:

My project will work – along with other projects – to shape the aesthetic experience by helping audience members engage in a meaningful way with the exhibit, hopefully functioning as something more than passing ephemera.

## Deadlines/Milestones

By February 5th I’d like to have my audio files selected or at least know what sort of files I’m searching for. By February 26th I plan to have a first draft of the Max patch so that I can focus on refining it. In early March I’d like to set up a demo instillation/workshop so I can see how the patch re-acts to being out in the world. 
For March 20th I plan to be doing final tweaking of the performance of my patch that way I can present it on April 2nd, and finish the write up for the 16th. 

## Support:

Some Max troubleshooting will probably be handy along the way. Also I will need the school to provide some of the materials for the instillation (listed above).
I’m always down for reading lists or projects in the sound art world.

## Project Outcomes:

I hope to have the piece achieve a level of audience engagement beyond passive listening, where people are provoked to think about sound in the context of the exhibit as well as the novel.

I want the piece to be able to shape the aesthetics of the exhibit in a meaningful way while not over powering the other items in the exhibit. 

## Learning Goals:

I want to improve my Max coding abilities while exploring the possibilities of sound art – a practice that is new to me.

I want to attempt to create an aesthetic object that enables (force?) viewers to think with (or just engage with) the exhibit rather than listen passively.
