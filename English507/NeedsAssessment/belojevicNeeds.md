# Needs Assessment

## Project Title: HyperLit

## Polished project description: 

For our project we are going to develop a prototype that offers a model for “gamifying” the “deep attention” necessary to engage with a complex and demanding text such as James Joyce’s *Ulysses*, while simultaneously fostering awareness of the imbalance between hyper and deep attention that is a result of the heavily media- and digital-driven economy of the fragmentary “now.” According to N. Katherine Hayles, there is a contrast between “deep attention and hyper attention,” with deep attention being characterized by “concentrating on a single object for long periods,” while hyper attention is characterized by “switching focus rapidly among different tasks” ([Hayles](http://www.mlajournals.org.ezproxy.library.uvic.ca/doi/abs/10.1632/prof.2007.2007.1.187) 187). She suggests that there is currently a widespread shift from deep attention to hyper attention as a result of a barrage of media modalities vying for attention. Our model will demonstrate how a gamified approach to “deep attention” might foster a critical awareness about the divide between hyper attention and deep attention, while also encouraging new forms of engagement with classic literary works. 

Our prototype will be developed using [Balsamiq](http://www.balsamiq.com/) in order to develop mockups of the app that demonstrate what a polished form of the application might look like. The game we envision for this app could function through a Google Calendar API that recognizes a user’s schedule that, in conjunction with the user’s determined “type” (based on questions, habits, tendencies etc. to be specified during profile creation), visualizes a suggested “hyper to deep attention ratio” for that day. The app will find “deep attention gaps” within one’s unique schedule where reading time towards *Ulysses* can be allotted. Reading progress can be monitored in two ways: either the user can chose to read a digital edition provided through the app that will automatically track their progress through the novel or, if a user prefers a print version, they can manually input their progress into the app. Following each “segment” of the novel, a “feedback” box will appear, allowing user’s to provide personal critical responses to the text; user’s will receive bonus points the more feedback they provide and the more social engagement they generate. If no feedback is given, minimum points will be awarded. In addition to points, a unique web comic will visualize one’s day based on preset categories, while also providing a panel or illustration unique to the segment of the novel just read. In addition to this, users will receive unique “badges” for finishing a novel. The user will have options to share comments, badges, and visualizations of the everyday/readings on their preferred social media network (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, etc.). Users can give other users/friends “kudos” for finishing a novel, comment on one’s progress/discuss the readings, or challenge friends to finish a book in a certain amount of time or read “x” amount of books in a month.

The final product of this project will be a video composed of mockups, rationale, and ideal outcomes to be featured at the exhibit and online; a  brief and silent projection could easily be setup at the exhibit describing the prototype. 

## List of Materials: 

* Balsamiq
* Final Cut Pro
* Digital Camcorders
* A Comic Artist (Alicia?) 
* A Videographer (to be self taught or convinced with treats) 
* Possible need of lab/studio space 

## Scope: 

Based on the materials listed, we will have a completed and polished video demo of the HyperLit speculative design model ready to present for April 2nd, 2013. The work will be completed by Jon and Nina with help from Alicia, along with possible help from actors and videographers from the UVIC Fine/Visual Arts department. Additionally, if progress is good and we have a presentable prototype to share, we will demo our work at the “Games without Frontiers” event to be held on March 9th, 2013 at UVIC. 

## Deliverables:  

* Balsamiq screen mockups of the interface and key interactions of the app 
* Select Web Comic images to be placed within or in relation to the mockups 
* A short video explaining the critical significance of the project to be placed on the exhibit’s website
* A (silent) video to be displayed at the exhibit   

## Risks and Constraints: 

If this project goes well, we would be interested in pursuing it further over the next couple of semesters. Since we are both enrolled in the Game Theory and Development course at the DHSI, it is feasible that we could carry out the vision of our prototype into a project throughout the summer semester. However, given that this is a speculative design piece with what will be essentially a design fiction approach (the video), the balance between critical provocation and technological feasibility will be a key challenge throughout this project.  

## How your project will benefit others, and who: 

Our project provides a speculative but practical approach to critically assessing and addressing the reality of today’s highly digitized, media-driven economy and world. The design model will aim to bring awareness to the highly attention- and productivity-driven environment we live in, visualizing individual's habits as they fit into the digital economy and highlighting to the shift from deep attention to hyper attention in younger generations. What’s more, if realized, our project has the chance of making literature and reading fun, social, accessible, and rewarding for a wide range of audiences. 

## Deadlines and Milestones: 

* Final Articulation of Polished Project Details Plan: February 8th 
* Defition of Necessary Screen Content and Interactions/Scenarios: February 10t - February 17th
* Mockups Development: February 18th - March 3rd 
* Web Comic Development: February 18th - March 3rd
* Mockups and Web Comic Images Deadline: March 4th (possible presentation at Games w/o Frontiers event on March 9th) 
* Storyboard and Script Deadline: March 11th 
* Video Shoot: March 18th-20th
* Editing: March 21st-29th 
* Final Deadline: April 2nd; Presentation of our project (video containing mockups etc.) at the 507 roundtable.  

## Support: 

* We need help with the web comic component (neither of us can draw)  
* Assistance (and/or training) with shooting/editing video 
* Become comfortable with Balsamiq and, possibly, inDesign (for possible web/blog component or for more developed comps to present in the video) 
* Possible coding workshop TBD 

## Outcomes or Goals:

1. A video presentation that achieves the speculative design objectives articulated by Jonathan Lukens in ["Speculative Design and Technological Fluency"](http://ijlm.net/fandf/10.1162/IJLM_a_00080).

2. The creation of a model that allows for feasible realization of a application that successfully gamifies literary texts in a progressive and fun way. 

## Personal Goals
1. I want to use this opportunity to learn how to conceptualize and develop a digial project driven by theoretical, critical, speculative thinking rather than the usual client-, user-, or market-driven perspective. I hope that this project will be a way to communicate a speculative but thought-provoking critique of the current information age, while simultaneously offering a practical and techonlogically feasible solution to a very real situation (i.e. the hyper and deep awareness split).
2. I want to gain skills in graphic and interaction design through the development of mockups (using Balsamiq) and possibly more detailed comps (using inDesign or other tools). I also hope to learn some basic videography and video editing skills during our video development for this project.
