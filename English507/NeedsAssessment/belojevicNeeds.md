# Needs Assessment

## Project Title: HyperLit

## Polished project description: 

For our project we will create a speculative design model for a gamified social reading environment called *HyperLit*. Our concept for this app aims to achieve a number of functions that bridge a critical social perspective with the material realization of an app that people would use. With this design mode, we are trying to:

* Bring awareness to the cyclical daily habits that feed into forming productive subjects that do not only engage in "labour production" when they're at work, but engage in forms of commodified leisure time during which surplus labour power is drawn from them (see Jonathan Beller's ["Paying Attention"](http://cabinetmagazine.org/issues/24/beller.php) and [*The Cinematic Mode of Production*](http://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Cinematic_Mode_of_Production.html?id=Kpvk-q33mrUC)). While a "productivity app" may be a surprising environment to achieve this, we feel that it is exactly by leveraging this environment that we can create transparency and make our critique stand out.
* Create a function in the app that inserts time for users to read classical literature instead of engaging in "cinematic" forms of entertainment (Beller) or the type of cultural consumption by mass society that Hannah Arendt refers to in ["Society and Culture"](http://www.jstor.org/stable/20026571?origin=JSTOR-pdf).
* Balance "Hyper Attention" and "Deep Attention" as encouraged in Katherine Hayles' ["Hyper and Deep Attention"](http://www.mlajournals.org.ezproxy.library.uvic.ca/doi/abs/10.1632/prof.2007.2007.1.187). The app will allow all types of users to engage in close, analytical reading (usually associated with deep attention) by incorporating functions for the hyper attentive user (e.g. links to relevant web content, marginal space to comment and discuss the text while reading it, etc.)
* Use the image-based screen (the current platform of Beller's "attention economy") to encourage a very different type of activity that does not feed into the mainenance of the socioeconomic hierarchy but enables all types of users to engage in critical, analytical, and interpretive reading, thinking and discussion.
* Use the digital space to create a relationship to the classics and history in a current, social, but yet narrative manner (in response to Alan Liu's ["Friending the Past"](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/new_literary_history/summary/v042/42.1.liu.html)).

In order to communicate the combination of social critique and app, we plan to develop a speculative design fiction video. Following Jonathan Lukens' argument in ["Speculative Design and Technological Fluency"](http://ijlm.net/fandf/10.1162/IJLM_a_00080), we hope that this format will allow us to approach our project primarily from a critical and concept-driven perspective, instead of simply developing a functional project based on market demands and usability.

The visual assets for our prototype will be developed using [Balsamiq](http://www.balsamiq.com/) in order to develop mockups of the app that demonstrate what a form of the application might look like. If we need to communicate the look and feel of the app more clearly, we may use Illustrator after the mockups are completed in order to create more fleshed out comps. The game we envision for this app could function through a Google Calendar API that recognizes a user’s schedule that, in conjunction with the user’s determined “type” (based on questions, habits, tendencies etc. to be specified during profile creation), fills in empty time slots with "Reading Time" of classical literature. Thus the app will find “deep attention gaps” within one’s unique schedule where reading time towards *Ulysses* can be allotted. The user's day will also be visualized as an illustrated web comic, bringing awareness to the cyclical, daily activities of the user in a tongue-in-cheek, somewhat sarcastic, manner. Within this visualization, "Reading Time" will be indicated by illustrating the scene that the user is scheduled to read at the corresponding time.  Reading progress can be monitored in two ways: either the user can chose to read a digital edition provided through the app (accessible via their desktop browser or tablet) that will automatically track their progress through the novel. The reading interface has an in-browser option and a full-screen option. In both views the text will contain hyperlinks to relevant online content (in order to help the user understand the text, recognize allusions, etc.), marginal scholarly annotations, as well as social annotations that the user can add to and comment on. Following each “segment” of the novel, a “feedback” box will appear, allowing user’s to provide a personal critical responses to the text; user’s will receive bonus points the more feedback they provide and the more social engagement they generate. If no feedback is given, minimum points will be awarded. In addition to this, users will receive unique “badges” for finishing a novel. The user will have options to share comments, badges, and visualizations of the everyday/readings on their preferred social media network (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, etc.). Users can give other users/friends “kudos” for finishing a novel, comment on one’s progress/discuss the readings, or challenge friends to finish a book in a certain amount of time or read “x” amount of books in a month.

The final product of this project will be a speculative design fiction video composed of mockups, rationale, and ideal outcomes to be featured at the exhibit and online; a  brief and projection could easily be setup at the exhibit describing the prototype. 

## List of Materials: 

* Balsamiq
* Adobe Illustrator
* Final Cut Pro
* Digital Camcorders
* A Comic Artist
* A Videographer (to be self taught or convinced with treats) 
* Possible need of lab/studio space 

## Scope: 

Based on the materials listed, we will have a completed and polished video demo of the HyperLit speculative design model ready to present for April 2nd, 2013. The work will be completed by Jon and Nina, along with possible help from actors and videographers from the UVIC Fine/Visual Arts department. Additionally, we will demo our work at the *Games without Frontiers* event to be held on March 9th, 2013 at UVIC. 

## Deliverables:  

* Balsamiq screen mockups of the interface and key interactions of the app 
* Select Web Comic images to be placed within or in relation to the mockups 
* Website comps showing look and feel using Illustrator
* A short video explaining the critical significance of the project to be placed on the exhibit’s website
* A video to be displayed at the exhibit   

## Risks and Constraints: 

If this project goes well, we would be interested in pursuing it further over the next couple of semesters. Since we are both enrolled in the Game Theory and Development course at the DHSI, it is feasible that we could carry out the vision of our prototype into a project throughout the summer semester. However, given that this is a speculative design piece with what will be essentially a design fiction approach (the video), the balance between critical provocation and technological feasibility will be a key challenge throughout this project.  

## How your project will benefit others, and who: 

The critical foundation behind HyperLit is twofold. Firstly, it responds to the cyclical structure of habits that shape us as productive subjects. Activities that are often perceived as pure leisure time (e.g. watching movies, playing video games, going to yoga class, etc.) actually help to maintain the dominant socioeconomic structure by adding value to commodified leisure activities through attention and engagement, drawing  surplus-labour productivity from people who engage in these activities, and providing  perceived physical and psychological well-being of individuals so that they can return to being productive subjects the next day (see Jonathan Beller's work). The HyperLit app will display illustrations of the users' daily activities through a plugin to their calendar, thus drawing attention to the relation between the personal calendar and the self as a productive force in the socioeconomic structure.

Secondly, within Beller's "attention economy," we consider Katherine Hayles' distinction between "hyper" and "deep" attention. Drawing on the notion that deep attention becomes increasingly difficult in a hyper-attentive generation, Hayles calls for a shift in educational educations that allows for a combination of attention modes. With this in mind, HyperLit caters to a variety of reading habits and interpretive skills, with the aim to offer access to a wide range of audience types to engage in the deep attention required for close reading and literary analysis within a platform that hyper-attentive readers are comfortable and adept in using. Hence, our project aims to conflate these modes of attention to encourage wider and greater interest in classical literary works.

## Outcomes or Goals:

1. Present mockups at the Games Without Frontiers event and gather responses and feedback.

2. Develop a video presentation that achieves the speculative design objectives articulated by Jonathan Lukens in ["Speculative Design and Technological Fluency"](http://ijlm.net/fandf/10.1162/IJLM_a_00080).

3. Create a model that allows for feasible realization of an application that successfully gamifies literary texts in a progressive and fun way. 

4. Prepare a video and establish a set up that can be incorporated in the *The Long Now of Ulysses* exhibit.

## Personal Goals
1. I want to use this opportunity to learn how to conceptualize and develop a digial project driven by theoretical, critical, speculative thinking rather than the usual client-, user-, or market-driven perspective. I hope that this project will be a way to communicate a speculative but thought-provoking critique of the current information age, while simultaneously offering a practical and techonlogically feasible solution to a very real situation (i.e. the hyper and deep awareness split).
2. I want to gain skills in graphic and interaction design through the development of mockups (using Balsamiq) and possibly more detailed comps (using inDesign or other tools). I also hope to learn some basic videography and video editing skills during our video development for this project.
