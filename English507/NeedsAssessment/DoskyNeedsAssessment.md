# NEEDS ASSESSMENT

## Title: 

"Stimulating the Seconds and Marking the Minutes: Annotating the Hours of *Ulysses*"  

## Scope

I will develop an arena for commentary using [Timeline JS](http://timeline.verite.co/). Visitors to my proposed digital space will have the opportunity to annotate three excerpts from *Ulysses* with multiple media that will then be plotted on a timeline that charts the single day during which the novel occurs. The timeline itself will remain separate from the physical space of the exhibit. However, the annotations produced in the digital space will contribute to rotating content for the exhibit. Visitors to the website will annotate the randomly selected excerpts of *Ulysses* with multiple media in order to produce a collaborative critical reading of the text and present some of the ways *Ulysses* is iterated in contemporary life. During the past few weeks I have struggled to find people willing to participate in my project. Therefore, I have decided to focus on gathering a substantial number of annotations (approximately 25) for each of three excerpts that I have selected: "Telemachus," "Circe," and "Nausicaa." Limiting my project to three of the excerpts will make the scope of my project manageable and will ensure that each excerpt has been analyzed by a considerable number of contributors. Also, in light of the fact that I have received many responses that lack critical insight, I plan to distinguish or highlight responses that do provide useful historical context/critical commentary on the excerpts from those that do not. However, I will keep all of the annotations that I have received thus far.

## Final Prompt 

In /Ulysses/ James Joyce presents his readers with a broad range of intertexts that situate them in the midst of a dizzying web of rapidly proliferating allusions. 

Since the Twentieth Century, a number of social, political, cultural, and economic upheavals, in conjunction with rapid technological developments, have shifted contemporary conceptions of temporality. In the digital age, our mediums for communication are increasingly referential. We are able to arrange and navigate information at an accelerated rate and with growing ease. Today you have the potential to read and exchange more information than would have been possible during the early Twentieth Century. As a result, our conceptualization of temporality is compressed. 

Therefore, it is not surprising that /Ulysses/ resonates with a contemporary audience that continues to experience the sense of bewilderment brought on by the rapid industrialization, nascent globalization and sizeable economic shifts of the Twentieth Century. 

This project strives to point to some of the ways in which the past continues to figure prominently in contemporary life.  Brian Eno refers to our inability to escape the past as “The Long Now.” By annotating an excerpt of /Ulysses/, you will situate Joyce’s modernist icon at the centre of our own web of allusive media.

In /Ulysses/, Joyce explores the hours in a typical day. Now it's your turn to mark the minutes and stimulate the seconds by drawing connections to elements of your everyday. Your commentary will then contribute to a repository that tracks the vibrant and multifarious afterlives of /Ulysses/, and will be displayed as part of the online portion of the University of Victoria’s forthcoming exhibit, “The Long Now of /Ulysses/.” Additionally, responses that offer unique and rich critical insight will contribute to content displayed in the the University of Victoria's Maltwood Gallery! We expect over 10,000 visitors as Congress 2013 will be held at the University of Victoria during the month of June. So, as Stephen Dedalus would say, “be just before you are generous.”  

Making a contribution is simple: choose a photo, video, quote, map, article, wiki, blog, or any piece of digital media from life after /Ulysses/ (1922-present) that you can relate to the randomly selected excerpt of the novel. Next, give a brief rationale (2-3 sentences) for your choice. Remember to work only with the excerpt provided!

For example, at the mention of "hoof-and-mouth disease" you might draw a connection to eruptions of hoof and mouth disease that have occurred since the early Twentieth Century, or you may want to add a link to a news article you have read recently that discusses the harmful effects of globalization. 

Below is the link to a randomly selected excerpt from "Circe":

## What will it deliver?

My project will produce a publicly accessible critical reading of randomly selected passages of *Ulysses* in addition to being a source for rotating content that will appear in the actual exhibit space. It will draw a link between temporality in the early 20th Century and our present sense of time. Contributors will produce critical readings based only on a preview of *Ulysses*. The website will link *Ulysses* to our contemporary everyday, expand the intertextual possibilities of Joyce's novel and also expose the increasing literary relevance of the multimodal technologies that are a salient part of our everyday lives.

For the material portion of my project I will collaborate with Zaqir. We will fuse our work in a way that foregrounds issues of temporality that inform both of our projects. We will develop a first draft of our curation plan for the material exhibit by the end of the week.  

The annotation system that I am creating will provide opportunities for visitors to contextualize the passage in terms of historical events, specific cultural milieus or biographical contexts, yet the annotations will always be rooted in the contemporary everyday as they will be comprised of various forms of digital media. Even if the exhibit-goers move from questioning the text to free associating with it (as they have), certain questions will inevitably be raised from a critical standpoint, if only at a metacritical level. At the very least, the finished product will inspire its viewers to form questions surrounding the various ways we might go about reading texts in a digital age.  

I will create a website using WordPress. The timeline will be embedded in the site, which will provide detail and background on my project. I would like to point people who visit the Maltwood Gallery to my website so that they too can contribute to content that will be added to the exhibit in a series of instalments. 

## Risks and Constraints

My foremost concern at this juncture is that the group of close-readers I have recruited, for the most part, has not contributed in the way that I wanted them to (i.e. they have "free associated" randomly while marking up the text instead of contributing thoughtful annotations). However, I remain optimistic and refuse to admit that I have encountered an insurmountable issue.

I remain concerned that Timeline.js will not be able to manifest the content of my project in the way that I want it to--in a way that reflects the theory that informs it. I believe it is essential that the excerpts are visualized in an unwrapped string of text on the timeline with the annotations projecting out of the gaps in the relevant part of the excerpt. It is this particular schematic representation that will help to visualize two ideas that are central to the timeline: 1. our sense of time (when compared with the early 20th Century) is compressed and therefore, having the advantage of living in a world in which we are always connected, we are able to navigate more allusions than people would have been able to one hundred years ago. 2. Related to the first idea, visualizing the annotations as projecting from the gaps between words in the excerpts will make sense of the title: with our increased potential we will not only navigate the hours of *Ulysses*, but will also explore the nuances of it (in contemporary contexts), or, "stimulate the seconds and mark the minutes."  

Because of the time constraints that I will be under as I produce rotating content for the exhibit, I might instead consider transforming some of the content that my project generates into a single installment for the exhibit. 

## Benefits

Already my project has made the exhibit known among a large community of scholars. I have disseminated my project to professors to share with their students and have contacted many scholars through the MSA listserv, Joyce listservs, Twitter and by corresponding through e-mail. In many ways collecting data for my project has become an outreach initiative. It has introduced the exhibit to scholars who will be attending Congress in June and invited them to contribute content. Hopefully this will pique their interest in the exhibit make them more likely to visit the Maltwood Gallery in June when they are participating in Congress at UVic. It has also acted as a resource for one professor who was teaching a chapter from *Ulysses*.  

While many of the people visiting the exhibit will be humanities scholars, many will not. My portion of the exhibit will more than just scholars to engage with *Ulysses* by introducing a contemporary, everyday dimension to the excerpts from the novel.

## Additional Notes and Questions:

1. How would you deal with the free associations? Do you think there is value in them? I'm not even sure there are *any* insightful responses for "Circe." 
2. What are some viable options for taking the web-based content and transferring it into a material display that will appear in the library?
3. Is there a way you can envision modifying my project at this point so as to minimize its reliance on human participants?
