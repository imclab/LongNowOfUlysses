# NEEDS ASSESSMENT

## Working Title: 

"Stimulating the Seconds and Marking the Minutes: Annotating the Hours of *Ulysses*"  

## Scope

I will develop an arena for commentary using [Timeline JS](http://timeline.verite.co/). Visitors to my proposed digital space will have the opportunity to annotate randomly selected excerpts from *Ulysses* with multiple media that will then be plotted on a timeline that charts the single day during which the novel occurs. The timeline will remain separate from the physical space of the exhibit. However, the annotations produced in the digital space will contribute to rotating content for the exhibit. Visitors to the website will annotate the randomly selected excerpts of *Ulysses* with multiple media in order to produce a collaborative critical reading of the text. 

## Working Prompt 

Your sense of time and temporality is drastically different than it would have been during the early 20th Century.

In a digital age, all the information you could ever want access to is at your fingertips. Tikka, tikka, tikka, click. Communicating both locally and globally has never been easier. 

Consequently, you have the potential to read, learn, and exchange more information in a given day than would have ever been possible in the 1900s.

In *Ulysses*, Joyce tracks the hours in a typical day. Now it's your turn to mark the minutes and stimulate the seconds.

Share the digital pieces of your everyday that you associate with *Ulysses* and that contribute to its vibrant afterlife!

Choose a photo, video, quote, map, wiki, blog, or anything else that you think demands to be linked to the excerpt of *Ulysses* and mark up the related section of the text!

## What will it deliver?

My project will produce a publicly accessible critical reading of randomly selected passages of *Ulysses* in addition to being a source for rotating content that will appear in the actual exhibit space. It will draw a link between temporality in the early 20th Century and our present sense of time. Many of the website's visitors will produce critical readings based only on a preview (or a series of previews) of *Ulysses*. If everything goes according to plan, the website will link *Ulysses* to our contemporary everyday, expand the intertextual possibilities of Joyce's novel and also expose the increasing literary relevance of the multimodal media that are a salient part of our everyday lives.

Even if the forum for annotations devolves into the realm of free association, I am hoping that the prompt will keep people on some sort of critical track. The annotation system that I am creating will provide opportunities for visitors to contextualize the passage in terms of historical events, specific cultural milieus or biographical contexts, yet the annotations will always be rooted in the contemporary everyday as they will be comprised of various forms of digital media. Even if the exhibit-goers move from questioning the text to free associating with it, certain questions will inevitably be raised from a critical standpoint, if only at a metacritical level. At the very least, the finished product will inspire its viewers to form questions surrounding the various ways we might go about reading texts in a digital age.  

## Risks and Constraints

The main pitfall that I face is the possibility that there will be no visitors to contribute their annotations to my timeline. To err on the side of caution in this regard, I will attempt to recruit groups of contributors who are studying *Ulysses* at universities across the country. Still, there is the risk that the group of close-readers that I recruit will not contribute in the way that I want them to (i.e. they will "free associate" randomly while marking up the text instead of contributing thoughtful annotations). However, as I mentioned in the previous section, I do not envision this being an insurmountable issue.

Yet another point of anxiety at this stage is whether Timeline.js will be able to manifest the content of my project in the way that I want it to. I also wonder whether I will be able to modify it to allow for open access annotations. 

Finally, in terms of producing rotating content for the exhibit, my concern is for general feasibility. How can I gather the annotated information and compile it efficiently and effectively in a new form? Because of the time constraints that I would be under, the rotating content may appear to have been compiled haphazardly. 

## Benefits

My project will increase attendance at the exhibit as it will be a means of reaching out the the public. It will also make the exhibit known among a community of scholars who are presently studying *Ulysses*. It may also act as a resource that professors teaching courses can use in their classrooms to prompt discussion. It will extend the scope of the exhibit beyond Victoria by inviting said community to contribute content that will then appear in the exhibit.   

While many of the people visiting the exhibit will be humanities scholars, many will not. My portion of the exhibit will more than just scholars to engage with *Ulysses* by introducing a contemporary, everyday dimension to the excerpts from the novel.

## A Timeline For My Timeline

January 29th:
 
*  Assess needs and trim scope of project to a feasible size
*  Experiment with using a spreadsheet to build a timeline
*  Research the different ways in which Timeline.js can be easily modified and tailored to manifest my current vision
*  Troubleshoot or modify plan based on any limitations that become apparent
*  Contact scholars across the country who are currently teaching *Ulysses* and ask them if they would like their students to contribute to rotating content for the exhibit

February 5th:

*  Begin to customize timeline to reflect refined plan
*  Put up first excerpt of the novel for 560 to annotate--a test run

February 12th:

*  Work out any bugs after reviewing 560s contributions

February 26th: 

*  Put up the second excerpt and invite one of the contact groups to contribute their annotations
*  Devise a plan for transforming annotations into rotating content

March 5th:

*  Work out any issues that arise
*  Put up up another few excerpts and invite contact groups to annotate them

March 19th:

*  Put up up another few excerpts and invite contact groups to annotate them
*  Think about what will happen to the timeline when the exhibit has finished. Will the excerpts still be open for the public to annotate? How can this project remain useful in the long term?
*  Begin producing the rotating content

March 26th - April 16th:
*  Put up up another few excerpts and invite contact groups to annotate them
*  Continue to produce rotating content

## Necessary Support

*  Data form and model (Jentery)
*  Workshop on Photoshop/Indesign (related to a project I am working on for the exhibit in 560)

## What does success mean for my project?

*  Producing a working model and accompanying web component as well as a feasible plan for transforming the annotated text into rotating content for the exhibit.
*  Prompting a *critical* reading of the excerpts of *Ulysses*, although the project could still be a success if the annotations wind up being less intellectually robust  

## Outcomes for my own learning

*  Developing highly transferrable and marketable skills for future employment. In fact, I would prefer to rethink my proposed project in the event that it will not help me to advance a set of computing skills that are in high demand.
*  Learn about and actively engage in the process of creating an exhibit.

## Materials 

*  Excerpts of *Ulysses* that are OCR readable
*  Timeline.js

## Additional Notes and Questions:

*  Post excerpts on Reddit? (r/books)

*  Do I necessarily need to make all the passages available for annotation?
