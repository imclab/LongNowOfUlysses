# Sound and Vision: Bloom Vision

Through integrations of recreated early-twentieth century media and contemporary digital technologies, Sound and Vision offers attendees at UVic's "The Long Now of *Ulysses*" exhibit the opportunity to learn more about, and even experience the sights, sounds, and mediating technologies of the early-twentieth century: to potentially see and hear the world as Bloom, Joyce, and others living in the early-twentieth century did. In particular, Bloom Vision attempts to recreate Bloom's experience of stereoscopic photography in the novel. Invented and theorized in 1838 by Charles Wheatstone and refined throughout the nineteenth century, stereoscopy was an important precursor to cinema: just as cinema created the illusion of movement by a rapid succession of still images, the stereoscope created the illusion of depth by offsetting similar two-dimensional images and isolating the right and left eyes. The most popular version in the nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries -- likely the one referred to in *Ulysses* -- was the Holmes stereoscope, which we recreate here to not only provide the attendee with a material example of the referent, but to allow exhibit attendees to experience stereoscopic vision as Bloom and others living in the early-twentieth century would have.

## Needs

To recreate the Holmes stereoscope I require two lenses, plywood, doweling, wood glue, and access to a jigsaw; alternately, I could use a [kit](http://www.3dstereo.com/viewmaster/vn-holm.html). I also require sample images, preferably from [the Gis√®le Freund collection](http://library.uvic.ca/dig/JamesJoyceinParis.html), which I will scan, offset, and print for stereoscopic use. Lastly, in addition to the material object I hope to provide a digital 3D model, for which I require 3D stitching and modeling software access (probably at the Maker Lab), and some instruction (possibly in the form of a workshop). 

The following texts will help guide my research:

## Scope/ Goals

My goal is to have a functional recreated Holmes stereoscope for exhibit attendees to use during Congress, and to provide a 3D model for the device, including specifications and instructions, for either the exhibit's online component, or to facilitate subsequent recreations should the exhibit travel and/or see other incarnations. 

## Risks and Constraints

The most likely material constraint for this project is the difficulty of securing access to woodworking materials, especially a jigsaw. I should also add that my fine woodworking skills have greatly eroded since high school furniture-making classes; since then my only woodworking experience has been in framing carpentry and building concrete forms, which involve entirely different scales, tools, and skill sets from this project. One possible solution might be to simply use a [kit](http://www.3dstereo.com/viewmaster/vn-holm.html). Another possible issue is in locating appropriate images to use in the stereoscope. The [Freund photographs](http://library.uvic.ca/dig/JamesJoyceinParis.html) would be ideal in terms of content, but may be difficult to present stereoscopically: I plan to scan, offset, and re-print two slightly different versions of a single image, but stereoscopic photography often involves a difference in *angle* (i.e. in the actual camera angle between the original images), not merely in position. 

## Benefit to Exhibit-Goers

Bloom Vision attempts to recreate not only a material example of the type of stereoscope Bloom refers to in *Ulysses*, but the actual experience of stereoscopic vision. Nineteenth-century visual technologies -- photography, the magic lantern, stereoscopy, Edison's Kinetoscope,  the early cinema of attractions *etc.* -- changed the way people in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries experienced the world; these technological developments contributed to the everyday phenomenologies of modernity, and just as significantly informed the aesthetic experiments of modernism. Though subsequent technological innovations may hinder us in our ability to actually recreate and experience these phenomenologies, Bloom Vision represents a significant approximation, or gesture of empathy, and attempts to perform the novel's ethical imperative: to see as the Other -- in this case, as Bloom -- sees. 

## Dates and Deadlines

February 19 (Reading Break): have acquired stereoscope components and sample photographs; begin assembling the Holmes stereoscope and scanning/ testing photographs for use.
March 5: have completed assembly of the Holmes stereoscope and successfully tested images for stereoscopic use; have met with Jentery to learn 3D stitching software and begun to digitally model the recreated Holmes stereoscope.
March 26: both physical exhibit component (the actual stereoscope) and 3D digital model have been completed. Begin compiling documentation (including images, specifications, and instructions) for final report, and for online component of the exhibit.

## Support

1. Instruction and access to 3D stitching and digital modeling programs. 
2. Either access to woodworking tools, or a [Holmes stereoscope kit](http://www.3dstereo.com/viewmaster/vn-holm.html).

## Project and Personal Goals

My goal for this project is to have both a usable recreated stereoscope for exhibit-goers to experience stereoscopic vision, as well as a digital model so that the project can see further iterations in diverse uses and contexts. My personal goals for this project are to learn more about the role of cinema and photography (and the popular arts more generally) in *Ulysses*; to research and think about the ways that mechanical reproduction, its arts and technologies created paradigmatic shifts in the phenomenologies of modernity; to think about how contemporary technologies and media are performing a comparable role in our own society and culture; to gain experience in exhibit-building in the physical sense of the term, but also to get a sense of the possibilities for exhibit-building in our digital age (how can new technologies enhance our experience of an exhibit, or offer new experiences?); finally, to experience making, both manually and digitally, and better understand the material processes of both.
