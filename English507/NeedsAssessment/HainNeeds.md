# Sound and Vision: Bloom Vision

Through integrations of recreated early-twentieth century media and contemporary digital technologies, Sound and Vision (a blanket title for the exhibit contributions of Zaqir Virani, Mitch Renaud, and myself) offers attendees at UVic's "The Long Now of *Ulysses*" exhibit the opportunity to learn more about, and even experience the sights, sounds, and mediating technologies of the early-twentieth century: to potentially see and hear the world as Bloom, Joyce, and others living in the early-twentieth century did. In particular, Bloom Vision attempts to recreate Bloom's experience of stereoscopic photography in the novel. Invented and theorized in 1838 by Charles Wheatstone and refined throughout the nineteenth century, stereoscopy was an important precursor to cinema: just as cinema created the illusion of movement by a rapid succession of still images, the stereoscope created the illusion of depth by offsetting similar two-dimensional images and isolating the right and left eyes. The most popular version in the nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries -- likely the one referred to in *Ulysses* -- was the Holmes stereoscope, which we recreate here to not only provide the attendee with a material example of the referent, but to allow exhibit attendees to experience stereoscopic vision as Bloom and others living in the early-twentieth century would have.

## Needs

To recreate the Holmes stereoscope I require a [kit](http://www.3dstereo.com/viewmaster/vn-holm.html) (which has recently arrived), wood stain and glue. I also require sample images, from either [the Gis√®le Freund collection](http://library.uvic.ca/dig/JamesJoyceinParis.html) or Edward Quinn's [*James Joyce's Dublin*](http://www.amazon.ca/James-Joyces-Dublin-Edward-Quinn/dp/0436395002), which I will scan, offset, and print for stereoscopic use. In addition to the physical recreated stereoscope, I hope to provide a digital 3D model, for which I require 3D stitching and modeling software access (at UVic's Maker Lab in the Humanities), and some instruction (in the form of a workshop). Finally, I plan on making a short video documenting the processes of building and modeling the Holmes stereoscope, from the box to the exhibit; for this I require a digital camcorder and access to video editing software (both available at the Maker Lab).

## Scope/ Goals

My goal is to have a functional recreated Holmes stereoscope for exhibit attendees to use during Congress, and to provide a 3D model for the device, including specifications and instructions, for either the exhibit's online component, or to facilitate subsequent recreations should the exhibit travel and/or see other incarnations. I will also produce a short video documenting the processes of building and modeling the Holmes stereoscope.

## Risks and Constraints

Since I've decided to use a [kit](http://www.3dstereo.com/viewmaster/vn-holm.html), possible risks include shipping time and condition upon arrival (note: we received the kit Friday, March 1; all components were present and in fair condition). Another issue is in locating appropriate images to use in the stereoscope. I have been in contact with Chris Petter at Special Collections regarding use of the [Freund photographs](http://library.uvic.ca/dig/JamesJoyceinParis.html), and am waiting to hear back from him. Even if I am permitted access to these photographs, the risk remains that it may be difficult to render them stereoscopically, since stereoscopy depends on a difference in angle and position  between images (Dr. Sayers' suggestion -- that I re-photograph the images from different angles -- will likely remedy this possible difficulty). Finally, if one of my goals with this project is to allow exhibit-goers to "experience the sights, sounds, and mediating technologies of the early-twentieth century," another possible risk is in the anachronism of using the Freund photographs (taken in Paris, not Dublin, and in the late-1930s, not early-1900s). Another source I've looked into for photograph content is Edward Quinn's *James Joyce's Dublin*, which feature images of landmarks found in *Ulysses*, but which -- like Freund's photographs -- would be temporally out of place (shot in the 1970s). 

## Benefit to Exhibit-Goers

Bloom Vision attempts to recreate not only a material example of the type of stereoscope Bloom refers to in *Ulysses*, but the actual experience of stereoscopic vision. Nineteenth-century visual technologies -- photography, the magic lantern, stereoscopy, Edison's Kinetoscope,  the early cinema of attractions *etc.* -- changed the way people in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries experienced the world; these technological developments contributed to the everyday phenomenologies of modernity, and just as significantly informed the aesthetic experiments of modernism. Though subsequent technological innovations may hinder us in our ability to actually recreate and experience these phenomenologies, Bloom Vision represents a significant approximation, or gesture of empathy, and attempts to perform the novel's ethical imperative: to see as the Other -- in this case, as Bloom -- sees. 

## Dates and Deadlines

March 5: have received the Holmes stereoscope kit, decided on an appropriately-coloured wood stain, and begun compiling photographs to be rendered stereoscopically.
Intervening weeks: 3D model components of the stereoscope individually. Assemble the physical stereoscope for the exhibit. Collect photographs, digitally alter them (in position and angle), re-print them, and test them in the stereoscope. Compile sets of photographs to be included with the stereoscope for the exhibit.
March 26: both physical exhibit component (the actual stereoscope) and 3D digital model have been completed. 
Before April 16: Begin compiling documentation (including images, specifications, and instructions) for final report, and for online component of the exhibit. Begin editing footage for Bloom Vision mini-documentary. Write final report, including embedded images and video.

## Support

1. Instruction and access to 3D stitching and digital modeling programs. 
2. A [Holmes stereoscope kit](http://www.3dstereo.com/viewmaster/vn-holm.html), wood stain, and glue.

## Project and Personal Goals

My goal for this project is to have both a usable recreated stereoscope for exhibit-goers to experience stereoscopic vision, as well as a digital model so that the project can see further iterations in diverse uses and contexts. My personal goals for this project are to learn more about the role of cinema and photography (and the popular arts more generally) in *Ulysses*; to research and think about the ways that mechanical reproduction, its arts and technologies, created paradigmatic shifts in the phenomenologies of modernity; to think about how contemporary technologies and media are performing a comparable role in our own society and culture; to gain experience in exhibit-building in the physical sense of the term, but also to get a sense of the possibilities for exhibit-building in our digital age (how can new technologies enhance our experience of an exhibit, or offer new experiences?); finally, to experience making, both manually and digitally, and to better understand the material processes of both.
