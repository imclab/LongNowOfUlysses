#HyperLit

##Project Description: 

For our project we will  develop a prototype that offers a model for “gamifying” the “deep attention” necessary to engage with a complex and demanding text such as James Joyce’s Ulysses, while simultaneously fostering awareness of the imbalance between "hyper" and deep attention as a result of the heavily media and digital driven economy of the fragmentary “now.” According to N. Katherine Hayles, there is a contrast between “deep attention and hyper attention,” with deep attention being characterized by “concentrating on a single object for long periods” while hyper attention being characterized by “switching focus rapidly among different tasks” (Hayles 187). She suggests that there is currently a widespread shift from deep attention to hyper attention as a result of a barrage of media modalities vying for attention. Our model will demonstrate how a gamified approach to “deep attention” might foster a critical awareness about this divide between hyper attention and deep attention, while also encouraging new forms of engagement with classic literary works such as Ulysses. 

Our prototype will be developed using Balsamiq in order to develop “mock ups” of the app that demonstrate what a polished form of the application might look like. The game could function through a Google Calendar API that recognizes a user’s schedule that, in conjunction with the user’s determined “type” (based on questions, habits, tendencies etc to be specified during profile creation), visualizes a suggested “hyper to deep attention ratio” for that user/day. The app will find “deep attention gaps” or within one’s unique schedule where time dedicated to deep attention/reading a text (re: Ulysses) can be allotted. Reading progress can be monitored in two ways: either the user can chose to read a digitized version that will automatically track their progress through the novel or, if a user prefers a print version, they can manually input their progress into the app. Following each “segment” of the novel, a “feedback” box will appear, allowing user’s to provide personal critical responses to the text; user’s will receive bonus points for the more feedback and social engagement that they generate (a user's will be able to see their friends' progress on different texts, discuss/comment on texts etc). If no feedback or reflection is given, minimum points will be awarded. What's more, player's will have the option to read the full edition of a book or--if time is limited or one is very new to Literary works--one may chose to read a truncated version of the text that highlights critically important or famous points in the novel, allowing for a very accessible option to approach difficult literary works. Of course, more points (and, accordingly, badges) will be awarded for reading a text in full. In addition to points, a unique web comic will visualize one’s day based on preset categories, while also providing a panel or illustration unique to the segment of the novel just read. Finally, user’s will receive unique achievement “badges” for finishing a novel or completing a particularly difficult section. The user will have options to share comments, badges, and visualizations of their everyday and readings on their preferred social media outlet. User’s can give other user’s/friends “kudos” for finishing a novel, comment on one’s progress/discuss the readings, or challenge friends to finish a book in a certain amount of time or read x or y amount of books in a month.

The final product of this project will be a video composed of mockups, rationale, and ideal outcomes to be featured at the exhibit and online; a brief and silent projection could easily be setup describing the prototype. 

##List of Materials: 

Balsamiq
Final Cut Pro
Digital Camcorders
A Comic Artist (Alicia?) 
A Videographer (to be self taught or convinced with treats) 
Lab/studio space 

##Scope: 

Based on the materials listed, we will have a completed and polished video ready to present for April 2nd 2013. The work will be completed by Jon and Nina with help from Alicia, along with possible help from actors and videographers from the UVIC Fine/Visual Arts department. Additionally, if progress is good and we have a presentable prototype to share, we will demo our work at the “Games without Frontiers” event to be held on March 9th 2013 at UVIC. 

##Deliverables 

- Balsamiq screen mockups of the key interactions of the app itself 
- Web Comic images to be placed within or in relation to the mockups 
- A short video explaining the critical significance of the project to be placed on the exhibit’s website
- A silent video to be displayed at the exhibit itself 

##Risks and Constraints: 

If this project goes well, we would be interested in pursuing it further over the next couple of semesters. Since we are both enrolled in the Game Theory and Development course offered through the 2013 DHSI, it is feasible that we could carry out the vision of our prototype into a project throughout the summer semester. However, given that this is a speculative piece of design and essentially a piece of design fiction (the video), the balance between critical provocation and technological feasibility will be a key challenge throughout this project. However, given that a variety of health apps similar to HyperLit exist (Strava, Budge, Nikefit, etc), it is feasible, we think, that a app as the one we are proposing could exist. A reading app does, in fact, exist: Kobo, however, it is far less in depth than the app we are proposing. Another challenge with this project, then, will be to develop a product that is distinctive from reading apps such as Kobo or Kindle. 

##How your project will benefit others, and who: 

Our project provides a critical but practical approach to critically assessing and addressing the reality of today’s highly digitized media driven economy and world. What’s more, if realized, our project has the chance of making literature and reading fun, social, accessible, and rewarding for a wide range of audiences. 

##Deadlines and Milestones: 

Polished Project Details by February 8th 
Define Necessary Screen Content and Interactions/Scenarios February 10th 
Mockups Development February 18th-March 3rd 
Mockups and Web Comic Images ready for March 4th and presentation on March 9th 
Storyboard and Script by March 11th 
Video Shoot on the 18th-20th of March
Editing Completed by March 29th 
Deadline: April 2nd; Presentation of our project (video containing mockups etc) at the 507 roundtable.  

##Support: 

-We will need artistic support in creating web comic component  (neither of us can draw). 

-Assistance with shooting/editing video (Jon has access to the Fine Arts Lab) 

-Become comfortable with Balsamiq and, possibly, inDesign (for possible web/blog component) 

-Possible coding workshop TBD 

##Outcomes or Goals:

-A presentation that achieves the speculative design objectives articulated by Jonathan Lukens in “Speculative Design and Technological Fluency.” 

-The creation of a model that allows for feasible realization of an application that successfully gamifies literary texts in a progressive and fun way. 

##Personal Goals

First and foremost, I am interested in learning what goes into the process of designing a piece of speculative design such as the one we are proposing and becoming comfortable with the process of prototyping and modelling a project such as this. 

I am very interested in becoming comfortable/familiar with the process of creating an application (whether for mobile devices or as a browser add-on) such as HyperLit. While the 507 component of our project will be highly theoretical, there is, I think, an opportunity to take it a step further. We are both interested in "over achieving," in a sense. That is, to try to finish the prototype as early as possible (while still providing a solid and polished prototype) and, from there, to at least attempt to begin actually working on the app itself. With that said, I am interested in learning the necessary coding skills required to make the project happen.
