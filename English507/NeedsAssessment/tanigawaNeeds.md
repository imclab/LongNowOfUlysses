# Needs Assessment (Updated March 5)
## Working Title: Dislocating Ulysses
## Project Description: 

### Project 1 Description
This portion of the project rethinks a linear progression of both space and time by situating Ulysses in a past and present Dublin. For the first segment, three [historical maps of Dublin](http://voyager.library.uvic.ca/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=2283456) from the UVic Library's Special collection, including a map of Dublin during the Anglo-Norman invasion that situates Ulysses’ Dublin in a long colonial history, an 1876 map, and a 1925 map that represents Dublin around the time of Ulysses’ publication, are layered over one another to give a sense of how the path of the novel translates through time. The project will also map objects in the exhibit that represent objects locateable in Ulysses’ Dublin in order to re-situate the dislocated objects in their geotemporal location as suggested by the novel. 

### Project 2 Description
The second component of the project represents the time spent in each place relative to the amount of time the novel is situated in specific areas of Dublin. Using a scanned image of Special Collection's 1925 Dublin map, we will 3D model the map using Mudbox to render the map malleable to distortion. We will then raise the topography of the map in proportion to the number of words locatable in a region in Dublin over the number of words in the novel (roughly 265,000).  To determine this proportional relation, the number of total words in the novel are divided by the number of words anchored in a specific area of Dublin.  

## List of Materials: 

### Software: 
Google Earth
Mudbox 

### Documents: 
* Physical [maps of Dublin in Special Collection] (http://voyager.library.uvic.ca/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=2283456) 
* OCR of 1922 edition of Ulysses
* Acquisition List from 560

### Data: 
* a chart of the journey in Ulysses
* the total words count in the 1922 edition
* a division of the novel based on place and a calculation of words locatable in each place-based segment or a detailed timeline of the novel's movement through Dublin
* a list of the exhibit objects and a list of where the text locates these objects in Dublin (where applicable)

## Project Scope: 
Temporally, the project spans 1400 to 2013 and is spatially located in Dublin.
 
## Project Deliverable: 
The project delivers a website page that shows a Hypercity visualization of how Dublin has changed over time and how the journey charted by Ulysses might translate onto temporally distant Dublin maps. Its second component delivers a flash animation hosted on the site that shows a temporal distortion of an early 20th century map of Dublin from Special Collections. 
  
## Project Risks and Constraints: 
The primary constraint is time in terms of learning Hypercities, setting up an account, and learning how to convert Flash into HTML5 or learning a new program for animating a map.
 
## Project Benefits: 
This project benefits people interested in the novel's relationship to both space and time. It will provide accessible, visual access to the novel's progression throughout Dublin.  

## Timeline (Deadlines and Milestones): 
* April 16th: Deliver a tested, working site
* March 25th: Finish revisions to Google Earth layering for second test
*March 18th: Make placemarks for all objects 
*March 11th: Have a complete list of all the items and where they are located in Dublin
* March 4th: Finish mock up of Google Earth layering for first test
* March 1st: Finish Geocities layering (done)
* Feb 25th: Finish Flash animation of 19th century map
* Feb 18th: Have a small section of Flash animated map to prototype
* Feb 11th: Have scanned images of 19th century map and data from text analysis of the novel for time/space representation (done)

 
## Project Support: 
Alex and I may need help with the 3D modeling portion of Project 2. We will also need help with the 3D printing portion. 

## Project Goals/Outcomes: 
The first goal of this project is to produce a temporally layered map of Dublin using Google Earth in order to highlight the historical long now of Ulysses’ Dublin. In particular, the project uses the historical, medieval map in order to show how Ulysses engages, not only with the immediate question of English colonization, but with a much longer history of colonization dating back to the Anglo-Norman invasion. The second goal of the project is to highlight the dislocation of the physical, exhibit objects from their geospatial reference in the text and to bridge that gap by relinking these physical objects to their geospatial reference using digital means. The larger goal is to highlight the ways in which the analogue and digital can interact with one another and attempt to fill the gaps left by one or the other. 

## Personal Goals/Outcomes
I would like to get a better sense of how Ulysses engages with time and space and learn how to use digital means to represent geospatial relationship (e.g., how to use Hypercities or Google Maps).
