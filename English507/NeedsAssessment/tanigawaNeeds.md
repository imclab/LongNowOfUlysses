# Needs Assessment
## Working Title: Dislocating Ulysses
## Project Description: 

### Group Project Description: 
This project will support three geotemporal representation of Ulysses and its networks. From a central page, users will be able to navigate to 1) an annotated and animated world map which highlights the appearance of as many of Ulysses’ afterlives -- from the 1967 American film adaptation, to the translation of “Ithaca” into Farsi, to the Modernist Versions Project’s “Year of Ulysses” -- as possible since 1922, providing both a database of international “product” inspired by the novel and a visualization of the novel’s spatial and temporal reach; 2) [description of Networks for Ulysses] and 3) a display of historical maps of Dublin ranging from medieval Dublin to Dublin in the mid 20th century, including an animation of an early 19th century map that enlarges or shrinks the size of a given area on the map in relation to the amount of relative time the novel is situated in the particular area. 

### Section 3 Description
This portion of the project rethinks a linear progression of both space and time by situating Ulysses in a past and present Dublin. For the first segment, [historical maps of Dublin](http://voyager.library.uvic.ca/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=2283456) from the UVic Library's Special collections, ranging from the medieval period to 1948, are layered over one another to give a sense of how the path of the novel translates through time. The second component of this segment represents the time spent in each place relative to the amount of time the novel is situated in specific areas of Dublin. Using a scanned image of Special Collection's early 20th century Dublin map, the areas of Dublin will be animated using Photoshop and Flash to expand or contract in proportion to the narrative time spent in the area. To determine this proportional relation, the number of total words in the novel are divided by the number of words anchored in a specific area of Dublin.  

## List of Materials: 
### Software: 
Flash, Hypercities
### Documents: 
Physical [maps of Dublin in Special Collection] (http://voyager.library.uvic.ca/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=2283456), OCR of 1922 edition of Ulysses
### Data: 
A chart of the journey in Ulysses, the total words count in the 1922 edition, a division of the novel based on place and a calculation of words locatable in each place-based segment or a detailed timeline of the novel's movement through Dublin.

## Project Scope: 
Temporally, the project spans 1400 to 2013 and is spatially located in Dublin.
 
## Project Deliverable: 
The project delivers a website page that shows a Hypercity visualization of how Dublin has changed over time and how the journey charted by Ulysses might translate onto temporally distant Dublin maps. Its second component delivers a flash animation hosted on the site that shows a temporal distortion of an early 20th century map of Dublin from Special Collections. 
  
## Project Risks and Constraints: 
The primary constraint is time in terms of learning Hypercities, setting up an account, and learning how to convert Flash into HTML5 or learning a new program for animating a map.
 
## Project Benefits: 
This project benefits people interested in the novel's relationship to both space and time. It will provide accessible, visual access to the novel's progression throughout Dublin.  

## Timeline (Deadlines and Milestones): 
* April 16th: Deliver a tested, working site
* March 25th: Finish revisions to site for second test
* March 12: Finish site for first test
* March 4th: Finish Hypercities layering
* Feb 25th: Finish Flash animation of 19th century map
* Feb 18th: Have a small section of Flash animated map to prototype
* Feb 11th: Have scanned images of 19th century map and data from text analysis of the novel for time/space representation

 
## Project Support: 
I will probably want/need assistance using [Hypercities](http://hypercities.com/getting-involved/map-digitization-request-form/) or [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/)(looking through the sites has made me more uncertain about what each program is and is not capable of doing). The group may also need a few pages (a page for each mapping project) on the exhibit site if this is possible and ammenable to the online component of the exhibit.  

## Project Goals/Outcomes: 
The goal of this project is to produce a temporally layered map of Dublin using Hypercities "time slices" and to produce a Flash animated map that shows the progressive shift in time-space relationships from chapter to chapter. 

## Personal Goals/Outcomes
I would like to get a better sense of how Ulysses engages with time and space and learn how to use digital means to represent geospatial relationship (e.g., how to use Hypercities or Google Maps).
