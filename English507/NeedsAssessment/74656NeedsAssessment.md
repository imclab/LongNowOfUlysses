#Needs Assessment and Outcomes Statement
####Working Title: 
Ulysses CubeSat and Pioneer Plaque  

>The Ulysses CubeSat and Plaque project uniquely celebrates the Year of Ulysses from the University of Victoria.  As the project’s design is focusing on extending fragments of the original 1922 Ulysses text into ‘The Long Now,’ the Ulysses CubeSat/Plaque will reimagine the extension of Ulysses into a new universal framework.  Translating Ulysses in this way (prospectively for Space) challenges today’s notion of literary scholarship and transmission.  What boundaries restrict the transmission of literature?  What environmental mediums alter textual materials? How can literary scholarship exist in The Long Now – that is, as an endeavour “directing us out from its centrality” toward new mediums and times?

####Project Scope and Delivery:
>A complete Ulysses CubeSat project demands access to costly Pumpkin/CubeSat Kit materials, satellite assembly, satellite programming, and an etched Ulysses Pioneer plaque.  Given the project’s time frame, and material release copyright, a successful project would entail a small replica of a functional CubeSat project or a model of the Ulysses pioneer plaque for exhibition.  Replicas may be printed in 3D or assembled with other cost-effective materials.  A successful project would also include a refined project and assembly document. 
####Risks and Constrains:
>Acquiring and building a CubeSat Kit requires a significant source of funds which, currently, is unavailable in *The Long Now of Ulysses* budget.  If the project is to maintain working integrity (its intended functionality), the CubeSat Kit requires field-specific technical expertise to craft the Ulysses CubeSat into a functional LEO satellite.  Satellite construction is a lengthy process involving, at the very least, vacuum testing, software experiments, and clean-room construction.  The payload and CubeSat specifications will also need to be re-evaluated and adjusted (sometimes removed) to accommodate a thin Ulysses pioneer plaque.  Particular outcomes of the project, for instance, the binary transmission of *Ulysses*, require CubeSat software components for design.   The smaller replica of the Ulysses CubeSat kit still requires a large time-cost; however, constructing a virtual satellite using commercial parts is subject to particular copyright.  The Ulysses plaque will require both design and 3D print time.

####Personal Goals

I wish to learn and leverage current 3D software and drafting tools required for modelling a literary exhibit while acquiring a familiarity with the various steps involved in manufacturing a digital literary project from prototype to display.  I plan to investigate different interdisciplinary methods and technologies to theorize new environments for textual transmission and reception.
