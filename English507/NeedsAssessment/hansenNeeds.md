##Working Title: The Afterlives of *Ulysses*

##Project Description

This section of the project presents an annotated and animated world map which highlights the numerous and varied incarnations of *Ulysses* -- from the [1967 film adaptation](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062414/), to the translation of “Ithaca” into Farsi, to the Modernist Versions Project’s [“Year of *Ulysses*”](http://web.uvic.ca/~mvp1922/) -- since 1922. In providing a time-lapse animation of the novel’s movement around the globe over time, this section echoes the modernist fascination with time and place.       

##Materials

###Software

[Google Spreadsheet](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/spreadsheets); [Flash](http://www.adobe.com/products/flash.html) or mapping/animation software

###Document(s)

World map ([Google Maps?](https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&tab=ll))

###Data

Sample data -- [1990s? Farsi trans.];1995 Chinese trans.; 1994 Dutch trans.; 1993 Russian trans.; 1985 (1999) Hebrew trans.; 1984 Gaelic trans.; 1982 Arabic trans.; 1971 Georgian trans.; 1969-1976 Greek trans.; 1967 Slovenian trans.; 1964 Finnish trans.; 1949 Spanish trans.; 1934 1st authorized American version; 1931-1934 Japanese trans.; 1929 French trans.; and 1927 German trans. From [A Centennial Bloomsday at Buffalo](http://library.buffalo.edu/pl/exhibits/joycebloomsday/).

##Scope

Spatially, my section of this project will cover the globe, and temporally, it will cover from 1922 to the present. Because of the potential volume of data with which I can work, I will attempt to limit my mapping to what I would consider to be major points -- translations, stage and film adaptations, festivals, etc.  
 

##Deliverable

My project will deliver a Flash animation -- linked off the geotemporal or digital exhibit website -- which will populate a world map with notable incarnations of *Ulysses* since 1922. Visitors will be able to watch a short animation that will track the movement of *Ulysses* around the globe over the 90-year period since its publication, and will also be able to access information specific to each mapped point.

##Risks/Constraints

Perhaps the major constraint my project will face is access to information; because I intend to represent the global afterlife of *Ulysses*, I will need data about international translations, adaptations, performances, etc. This constraint leads to the major risk of my project: the leaving out of major incarnations of the text. Another possible issue that might arise is access and use of technology -- this will be my first experience using Flash, and I am not certain if I will be able to annotate the places I tag on the map as I would with a more academic software, such as [Neatline](http://neatline.org/).

##Benefits

A particular benefit of my project is that it will be extremely accessible to the general public. In an exhibit on the long now of *Ulysses*, visitors will be able to visualize the novel’s movement across the globe since 1922 by viewing a Flash animation that populates a world map. At the same time, the annotations will act as a resource for those who are interested in finding out more specific information about the various translations, adaptations, performances, etc. of *Ulysses*.    

##Deadlines

* 16 April: Deliver complete animation
* 25 March: Revise and preview again
* 12 March: Preview animation
* 4 March: Finish animation in Flash
* 25 Feb: Work on animation in Flash
* 18 Feb: Learn Flash -- how to populate map with data, how to annotate points
* 11 Feb: Have complete data set; have map to begin working on Flash

##Support

I will require support using [Flash](http://www.adobe.com/products/flash.html) and any additional software. As digital components of the exhibit, the geotemporal projects will need to be located in a central place -- will we be creating an exhibit website?

##Outcomes for Project

1. A data set that chronicles the translations, versions, and adaptations of *Ulysses*, as well as major journals, festivals, and events that were/are inspired by *Ulysses*.  
2. A Flash animation that populates a world map with the various incarnations of *Ulysses* since 1922.

##Outcomes for Learning

1. To compile a comprehensive database of all of the translations, etc. of *Ulysses*, which includes bibliographic and contextual information.
2. To use Flash to create a short animation of the global movement of *Ulysses* since 1922.
