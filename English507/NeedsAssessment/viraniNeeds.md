# Demisemiquavers: The Long Notes of Ulysses

It is my aim to bring the aspect of sound to the forefront of the Ulysses exhibit. As a text renowned for the textual representation of sound, Ulysses has provided the fodder for a long life of musical traditions and scores, and has left us much to tinker with. It is my intention to create an exclusive (rather than the time-killing inclusive) archive of versioned Ulysses sound material, ranging from the earliest iterations of 1904 (from the novelâ€™s setting) to current remediations of moments in the novel, be they soundtracks or concept albums. This repo will include source audio when available, and critically determined recreations when not. Scores of film adaptations and plays will be prominent feature, as the critical goal of this repo is to demonstrate the links between Ulysses and popular music. 

## References and Resources

The desired outcome is to mimic the functionality something as simple and effective as [The British Library's Sound Archive](http://sounds.bl.uk/ "redirect to Sounds.BL") with the interactivity of [Gource](http://code.google.com/p/gource/ "redirects to Gource")

The metadata of the archive will be transcribed in [Dublin Core](http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/elements.shtml), which is standard archival practice. This will be done in Google Spreadsheets to account for interoperability.

The standard conception of the repo is an extensive archive of metadata, in order for other works in the LongNowOfUlysses Exhibit to have the resource at their disposal. In addition, much like the library archives mentioned above, the data and repo will ideally be available for further study and use.  

## Scope

This project will not be an attempt to create an exhaustive inclusive archive of sounds. Considering the time frame, this would just be foolish and ineffective. With the time at hand, this project will consist of a critically determined selection of audio representative of the major moments of sound in the text (such as instances in Sirens, Circe, and Wandering Rocks, among others). With these selections, soundtracks to these moments will be generated for the exhibit, as well as the Ulysses web presence of the exhibit. 


## Delivery

What the project will actually deliver: a sound archive representative of instances of mediations of Ulysses over the last century, visually accesible in the exhibit, along with pieces of audio for use in the exhibit's multifaceted environment and web presence. 

##### Soundtrack
The exhibit soundtrack will consist of audio from this repo linking to Mitch Renaud's MAX/MSP patches, obtained through a shared cloud storage.

##### Versioning/Visualizations
The versioning will likely be displayed through Laura Dosky's TimeLine features, and visualizations will bounce between the TimeLine and a possible inclusion of a voyant visualization, aimed at showing sound frequency in the Ulysses excerpts.

##### Mapping
The mapping project of Alex Christie and Katie Tanigawa will be linking to the DC Metadata of the spreadsheet, taking the dual geo-tagging applied to the audio in order to map it. 

##### Further Use
The archive will remain accesible through the DC Metadata, which will be converted to XML and stored through David Carleton's archival markup project.

## Who Gains

Musicians and audiophiles aside, this component of the exhibit will provide an interesting entry-point for anyone to access Ulysses. Having read the novel will provide context for some of the pieces, but the aural mosaic that will be pulled from Ulysses will become its own art to be enjoyed, both historically and musically. The tribute album that built over the last ninety (or so) years. 

## Timeline/Milestones

1. Feb 12th - have the source audio and drawn scores assembled fully, along with justifications
2. Feb 26th - have audio archived in Dublin Core
3. March 12th - Data end finished, now work on physical presentation
4.  March 19th - have prototype to test through exhibit for each collaborative effort.
5. March 26th - Have all sound files finished, including repo and edits.
6. April - Hiccups and Roadblocks.
 
## Support

1. Likely a display monitor and headphone capability, or specific linking to the msp patching

## Goals

1. The succesful exhibition of selected sounds of Ulysses, documenting key points of the text's influence on music and media.
2. The application of generated sound files to the exhibit, adding an aural element.

For my own learning: 

1. The aquired knowledge of new archival software and applicable practice.
2. A viable means to connect audio engineering and recreation to literary studies pertaining to my scholarly research.
