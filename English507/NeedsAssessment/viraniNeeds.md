# Demisemiquavers: The Long Notes of Ulysses

It is my aim to bring the aspect of sound to the forefront of the Ulysses exhibit. As a text renowned for the textual representation of sound, Ulysses has provided the fodder for a long life of musical traditions and scores, and has left us much to tinker with. It is my intention to create an exclusive (rather than the time-killing inclusive) archive of versioned Ulysses sound material, ranging from the earliest iterations of 1904 (from the novel’s setting) to new recordings designed for the exhibit itself. This repo will include source audio when available, and critically determined recreations when not. Scores of film adaptations and plays will be prominent, as will episodic recordings with the intention of recreating a “stream-of-consciousness” type score.  

## References and Resources

The desired outcome is to resemble something as simple and effective as [The British Library's Sound Archive](http://sounds.bl.uk/ "redirect to Sounds.BL") with the interactivity of [Gource](http://code.google.com/p/gource/ "redirects to Gource")

[Adlib](http://www.adlibsoft.com/products/archive-software "redirects to the Adlib page") is the likely candidate software, as it both archives and visualizes.

Concerning the stream-of-consciousness aspect:
In musical speak, this essentially amounts to a "mash-up." In a critical attempt to explore and interpret the overlapping sounds of the episodes, a selection of the archived content will be spliced and edited together in the attempt to recreate some of the... "louder" moments in Ulysses. 
Recording, editing, and production will happen through: [Acoustica Mixcraft](http://www.acoustica.com/mixcraft/ "redirects to Acoustica") and
[Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/ "redirects to Audacity") if situations need it be so. 

Source Audio will be drawn from the [1967 Film adaptation of Ulysses](http://www.ubu.com/sound/joyce.html "redirects to Ubuweb/sounds/Joyce"), as well as the British Library Sound Catalog, and pre-existing archives such as [The Modern World's Joyce Collection](http://www.themodernword.com/joyce/music.html), as well as recreations when necessary. 

## Scope

This project will not be an attempt to create an exhaustive inclusive archive of sounds. Considering the time frame, this would just be foolish and ineffective. With the time at hand, this project will consist of a critically determined selection of audio representative of the major moments of sound in the text (such as instances in Sirens, Circe, and Wandering Rocks, among others). With these selections, soundtracks to these moments will be generated for the exhibit, as well as the Ulysses web presence of the exhibit. 

## Delivery

What the project will actually deliver: a sound archive representative of instances of mediations of Ulysses over the last century, visually accesible in the exhibit, along with pieces of audio for use in the exhibit's multifaceted environment and web presence. 

## Constraints

A potential constraint on this project is the issue of copyright. The majority of the source audio is either available as a copy-right free recreation, or out of copyright law and re-recordable. Material from the films or plays or albums, however, could prove difficult. I am currently unsure how to navigate this, as I am almost sure it will come up. Hopefully, UVic has some clout in this area. 

## Who Gains

Musicians and audiophiles aside, this component of the exhibit will provide an interesting entry-point for anyone to access Ulysses. Having read the novel will provide context for some of the pieces, but the aural mosaic that will be pulled from Ulysses will become its own art to be enjoyed, both historically and musically. The tribute album that built over the last ninety (or so) years. 

## Timeline/Milestones

1. Feb 12th - have the source audio and drawn scores assembled fully, along with justifications
2. Feb 26th - have audio archived in Adlib, with visualization-tree prepared, as well as strategy for exhibit presentation
3. March 12th - have any additional recreations written and recorded
4.  March 19th - have prototype to test through exhibit
5. March 26th - Have all sound files finished, including repo and edits.
6. April - Hiccups and Roadblocks.
 
## Support

1. The installation of a monitor and headhphones in the Maltwood space
2. Guidance/workshop on visualizing archival versioning

## Goals

1. The succesful exhibition of selected sounds of Ulysses, documenting key points of the text's influence on music and media.
2. The application of generated sound files to the exhibit, adding an aural element.

For my own learning: 

1. The aquired knowledge of new archival software and applicable practice.
2. A viable means to connect audio engineering and recreation to literary studies pertaining to my scholarly research.
