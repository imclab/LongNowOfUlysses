## Reading Joyce Digitally

"Reading Joyce Digitally" examines how we read in our so-called digital era. How is the digital age changing the way we read, both materially and cognitively?  "Reading Joyce Digitally" is an inventive remediation of *Ulysses* that maps data on web usage and web-based reading practices (a transcription of time elapsed per page, bounces, and domains compiled from a single twenty-four hour period of my own Google Chrome history) onto the reading of a complex novel. I use the technique of die-cutting to playfully explore Joyce's masterpiece, while at the same time responding to our current cultural moment, what N. Katherine Hayles defines as an emerging generational divide between "Hyper" and "Deep" attention as modes of cognition.How will print books adapt as we look toward the future? Does it matter? What does it mean to map the hyper attention of web-based reading onto a medium that requires engaging deep cognitive practices? What happens when we read a novel like *Ulysses* as if it were content on the web?

## Material I will need:

* Print Edition of *Ulysess* 
* Data on Web-Usage
* Cutting Mat
* Razor Blade
* Pen
* Ruler

## Focus and Delivery:

My project aims to create a "print+" version of Joyce's *Ulysses*. I expect the project to take two months. I realize that the work may not meet my initial aspirations in its final incarnation. Mainly, I hope the remediation process: challenges my own assumptions about the materiality of text and the privileging of hyper or deep cognition, the analog versus the digital, etc.; allows me to develop an appreciation for book design; and provides an opportunity to learn some digital/technological skills. My contribution will result in a thought-provoking artifact that questions how we read novels and considers the evolution of print in our current cultural moment.

## Anxieties and Hopes:

At present, I worry that the remediated novel will not achieve its purpose. That it will simply not be translatable.  My project could end up reading like an imbecilic arts and crafts project, with no real relevance to the exhibit or DH scholarship. I do not perceive any time or material constraints at the moment. I hope that the work will provoke its user to consider the materiality of text and contemplate how the digital is changing the way that we interact with media, print in particular, and *Ulysses* most particularly of all. The artifact will be of interest to those who visit the exhibit and are interested in book culture.

## Goals and Deadlines:

I will spend the next two weeks researching and refining the technique I will use to craft the project. I plan to have a prototype of the remediated text by March 6th. By March 19th, I will have refined my prototype and will have begun working on what will become the artifact for the exhibit. By March 26th I will be in the final stages, and I am to have completed my project by April 2nd. I will need help deciding how to mount the book in the exhibit. It would be useful to be directed to resources that are considering how digital technology is shifting human perception and cognition, how the digital is changing our culture generally, and how design has responded and evolved. Maybe even some speculative readings on what this might mean beyond our present moment. By the end of the term, I hope to have produced an imaginative and beautiful print remediation of *Ulysses*. I want my contribution to the exhibit to not only appeal visually and textually, but also challenge its users to think about the future of print and how digital environments are changing the way we interact with non-digital media. I want to learn more about book design, and design in general. I want to know how to make something with the help of a computer. And I also want to learn more about digital culture and how it is changing the way we think and perceive and proceed as human beings.
