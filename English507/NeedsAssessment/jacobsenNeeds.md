## Hyper/Text

"Hyper/Text" examines the role of the print book in our so-called digital era. With the decline of print book sales and the rise of digital editions, E-readers, Ipads and other screen-based reading devices, how do print books maintain their relevancy in today's culture? How will print books adapt as we look toward the future? Does it matter? 2012 marks the year of the first-ever digitized version of James Joyce's *Ulysses*. What does that mean for its print iterations? How is the digital age changing the way we read, both materially and cognitively?  "Hyper-Text" is an inventive remediation of an episode of *Ulysses* that uses various techniques, such as die-cutting, typography, graphic design and collage, to playfully explore Joyce's masterpiece, while at the same time responding to our current cultural moment, what N. Katherine Hayles defines as an emerging generational divide between "Hyper" and "Deep" attention as modes of cognition.

## Focus and Delivery:

My project aims to create a "print+" chapter of one episode of Joyce's *Ulysses*. I will need to have access to and learn how to use at least one design application. I expect the project to take two months. I realize that I will not become a graphic designer, and the project may not meet my initial aspirations in its final incarnation. Mainly, I hope the project challenges me to look at my own assumptions about the materiality of text, and at the same time allows me to develop an appreciation for book design, both digital and analog, and provides an opportunity to learn some digital design skills. My contribution will result in a thought-provoking artifact that questions how we read novels and considers the evolution of print in our current cultural moment.

## Anxieties and Hopes:

At present, I worry that the remediated chapter will not achieve its purpose. That it will simply seem like a flashy commodity. Although, really, that would even maybe be the best-case-scenario of the worst outcome. My project could end up simply seeming like an imbecilic arts and crafts project, with no real relevance to the exhibit or DH scholarship. To be honest, I am not sure I can define time or material constraints at the moment.I will have to return to this at a future date. I hope that my project will provoke its user to consider the materiality of text and think about how the digital is changing the way that we interact with media, print in particular, and *Ulysses* most particularly of all. The artifact will be of interest to those who visit the exhibit and are interested in book culture.

## Goals and Deadlines:

I will spend the next two weeks researching and refining the technique I will use to craft the chapter. I plan to have a prototype of the remediated episode by February 26th. At this time, I hope to have acquired the applications I will need, and to have gained proficiency in their use. By March 19th, I will have refined my prototype and will have begun working on what will become the artifact for the exhibit. By March 26th I will be in the final stages, and I am to have completed my project by April 2nd. I will need help deciding what type of apps I will use. It would also be useful to be directed to more resources that are considering how digital technology is shifting human perception and cognition, how the digital is changing our culture generally, and how design has responded and evolved. Maybe even some speculative readings on what this might mean beyond our present moment. By the end of the term, I hope to have produced an imaginative and beautiful print remediation of one chapter of *Ulysses*. I want my contribution to the exhibit to not only appeal visually and textually, but also challenge its users to think about the future of print and how digital environments are changing the way we interact with non-digital media. I want to learn more about book design, and design in general. I want to know how to make something with the help of a computer. And I also want to learn more about digital culture and how it is changing the way we think and perceive and proceed as human beings.
