The Data Model proper is here viewable as a [spreadsheet on Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmC4guPyb1GedHB0NnBGQmZUbkVxczJ1X1lOTHdfMlE&usp=sharing). The sample data however, is in a seperate file at the moment, while licensing and linkage is sorted out, which I have included below:


#Data Model 

To be created in the form of a spreadsheet, the elements of my Data Model drawn from Dublin Core are as follows:

######Secondary Coverage
	
An additional element of my own devising, in which the contextual coverage in relation to the text *Ulysses* will be covered as well. In this isntance, it isn't any different than the standard coverage. However, these co-ordinates point directly to the Monto district of Dublin, in which the events of *Circe* take place
