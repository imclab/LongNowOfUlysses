##Data Model
######74656
The data model for the EcoSat Ulysses transmitter is currently within the EcoSat Box drive.  As the UVic EcoSat team is competing in 2014 in the Canadian Satellite Design Challenge (CDSC), I require the permission of the EcoSat team before I can upload any public documents into GitHub.  The Ulysses EcoSat payload currently uses the page excerpts from the Long Now of Ulysses GitHub repository.  The design of the transmitter requires these images either appear as .png files or simple .txt files for satellite download/upload.  The size requirements of this data model can accommodate the entire text of Ulysses; however, as all of my data model payload materials must be space-grade, as per CDSC rules and regulations, EcoSat cost and power usage will alter my current design.
