# DATA MODEL AND SAMPLE DATA 

Building upon the preliminary research you've already done, now's the time for you to start gathering and structuring sample data, working on the assumption that existing standards, projects or conventions will (at least) inform the modelling process.  

## LEARNING OUTCOMES  

For you to: 

* Gather some sample data for your project.  
* Consider how (if at all) your project might converse or be interoperable with other, similar projects.  
* Make key decisions about how your work engages classification systems, and to what effects. 
* Give others in 507 a sense of the particulars of your project.  

## WHAT YOU SHOULD INCLUDE IN YOUR RESPONSE 

Your response should be saved as yourlastnameDataModel and submitted to the master branch of the [DataModel folder](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/tree/master/English507/DataModel). 

The response should include only your model and sample data. There's no need to write anything for now. However, you should use your 507 log to document decisions, surprises, and processes.  

Given the variance across your projects, the model can assume a variety of forms and formats, including spreadsheets, XML, diagrams, and wireframes. Together with the model, please include same data. In many cases, the sample data and model may be in the same document or file (e.g., a spreadsheet). In other cases, the data model may be applied to your data (e.g., the application of a schema in XML).  

If you are not sure how to construct your model, identify your data, and/or submit either to GitHub, then please email me ASAP. Thanks!
