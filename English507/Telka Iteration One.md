# Log 5: Iteration One

## Documentation
## 
I tend to work with both analogue and digital methods. For example, I
have three repositories for Engl507 material (2 analogue and one
digital): GitHub houses the logs assignments for Engl507, my Project
Binder houses a hardcopy of these logs and iterations of my project
(including manuscript drafts, SMART goals, JS’s feedback on my logs),
and a reading binder (includes annotated hardcopies of the course
readings and my reading journals – a basic template that structures my
response to the articles). This photo represents my three repos.

Another example of my analogue/digital hybrid method is this outline for
my Needs Assessment. I made a simple map of the project requirements
(represented in the blue (and one purple) squares in Inspirations. I
printed this out and added manuscript notes as I fleshed out my ideas.

Here’s a snapshot of what my desk looks like today as I work on this
Log. Taped to my wall, I have a manuscript draft of a weekly calendar
which represents what I’ll be working on and when; a manuscript draft of
projects coming due for my classes, a sticky-note map of my Engl502
project and presentation, and a list of SMART goals for this project.

Planning for this project included a series of concept maps to help
develop my ideas ideas. I use the commercial product,
[Inspirations](http://www.inspiration.com/).

This is an early map for my Thought Piece Log.

Interestingly, my ideas were more richly developed on the exhibit
outreach side rather than exhibit documentation. After the Thought Piece
Log I met with Jentery to help focus my idea. We decided that a
documentation project would allow me to pursue my interest in developing
learning opportunities within and beyond the exhibit and that it would
be a huge benefit to the project itself.

The following concept map (also composed in Inspirations) is a visual
representation of my workflow. I imagine using something like this in my
final project to visualize the workflow for other projects.

I used excel to structure my data model. I color coded dates for the
milestones and deadlines for everybody's projects. This helped my get a
sense of my own time line. You'll find my datamodel here in the 
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/DataModel/TelkaDataModel.xlsx)

To structure my document, I looked to the [NINCH guide](http://www.nyu.edu/its/pubs/pdfs/NINCH_Guide_to_Good_Practice.pdf). 
I visualized the structure in another Inspirations map and identified the purpose of each
section. Next, I considered the structure in terms of my content. Using this map as a 
blueprint, I made several smaller content-specific maps for each section. Planning and 
reflecting on the structural elements of my document so carefully
made drafting each section a cinche. 

## Draft Component

# How This Became That

## Preface

**Welcome Statement**

I am pleased to introduce the Long Now of Ulysses documentation manual
and exhibit guide. Since the exhibit’s conception, much thought,
imagination, and expertise has gone into its production.

**History/Purpose of Exhibit**

The Long Now of *Ulysses* presents *Ulysses* – the novel by James Joyce and
a keystone of modernist literatures – as its organizing artifact. The
novel is featured in celebration of the first-ever digital publication
of the text by the Modernist Versions Projects. Using the text as a
springboard, the exhibit features excerpts from the text along with rich
contextual, historical, cultural, and aesthetic materials in a range of
media. The exhibit is housed at the Maltwood Gallery at the University
of Victoria. It can be viewed from June 1 to _____ 2013 during library
hours. ….Need a statement about the long now…..

The exhibit is the result of collaboration between English Department
faculty, graduate students in Engl507 and 560, and the UVic libraries.
Under the leadership of Dr.’s Jentery Sayers and Stephen Ross, graduate
students have contributed original ideas for materials, design, and
technologies.

The Long Now of *Ulysses* is more than a literary exhibit. It extends
beyond the Maltwood Gallery into digital environments. It aims to engage
an audience beyond the gallery itself. These digital environments
provide learning and research opportunities for distant audiences who
are unable to visit the material exhibit and those local audiences
interested in extending their gallery experience. Integrating the
exhibit’s artifacts with multimodal technologies, the online components
provide individuals and learning communities with meaningful
opportunities to interact with the textual and contextual histories (and
futures) of *Ulysses*, modernism, and the Long Now.

**Acknowledgements**

This document is a collaborative endeavor. It relies on the creative
innovations, intellectual work, and logistic support of several groups
and individuals. First, it owes a large debt to the UVic Libraries whose
integral infrastructural support includes provisioning the exhibit space
in the Maltwood Gallary and promoting the exhibit on campus and within
the community. The UVic Department of English must also be acknowledged
for their infrastructural contributions, which includes administrative
and financial support. Thanks are also due to the Modernist Versions
Project and the UVic Maker Lab.

Next, this document was created under the editorial guidance of Dr.
Jentery Sayers. By extension, Dr. Stephen Ross’ curatorial role in the
exhibit significantly though indirectly informed this guide. The success
of this document and the exhibit itself relies on their editorial and
curatorial leadership and mentorship.

Finally, this guide is grounded in the creative and intellectual work of
my graduate colleagues from Engl507. I’ve compiled and rendered their
individual and group contributions into this guide. The success of the
exhibit and this guide relies on their brilliant innovations and
productive collaborations.

**Values and Best Practices**

As a collaborate effort, this guide proudly embodies some core values
aligned with Digital scholarship. Resource sharing, open-access,
peer-review, and interoperability comprise the foundations of our
methods. We value the opportunity to share the ideas and resources that
informed the creation and curation of the Long Now of *Ulysses*. It is our
hope that this guide informs visitors to the exhibition at the Maltwood
Gallery and online. Further, we hope that scholars, librarians, and
cultural heritage professionals find this guide useful in the conceptual
and practical design of future literary exhibits.

Each component of the exhibit was subject to peer-review from the
initial conceptual phase to its installation (in the gallery and online
environments). In the initial conceptual phases, each student and group
of students presented their ideas informally in the seminar and each
presentation was followed by a Q & A period. Further, Dr. Jentery
Sayers included formal seminar assignments documenting the projects –
including workflow, methods, materials, and resources -- as they
developed. These formal assignments were submitted to GitHub, an
open-access repository hosting the iterative development of the Long Now
of Ulysses.  Furthermore, each iteration of this guide underwent a
rigorous process of peer-review by my collaborators in Engl507.

This guide was created with interoperability as a primary goal. By
interoperable, I mean it aims to be accessible to a broad audience
across disciplines, campuses, and communities. I’ve eliminated
discipline specific jargon so that the literary exhibit and its
components convey meaning for non-specialist audiences. Further, its
technologies are (almost?) always open-access and open-source. The
technologies and applications were chosen not only for their open-access
but also for their interoperable design. Finally, this guide provides a
framework free of content-specific material. In this sense, its readers
can reconstruct the exhibit using our methods but with a variety of
content.

We invite you to use this guide to inform the conception and curation of
your own literary exhibit or exhibit extensions. It’s collaborators
encourage you draw upon their own research and methods to inform your
project. Making our process transparent – and indeed teaching our
methods to others – helps build a community of learners and fosters a
more collaborative, interactive, interoperable mode of scholarship. We
invite you to use this guide and expand/innovate upon it for your own
purposes.

## Introduction

**Purpose**

The purpose of this document is twofold. First, it documents and renders
the methods, theories, and practices of the Long Now of *Ulysses*, in
general, and the 507 collective, in particular. In this sense, exhibit
goers (both distant and proximal) can access the theories and methods
behind the exhibit itself. By making our process transparent, we hope to
engage our audience in a peer-review process and creative, intellectual
conversations that invite us to think closely about our scholarly
practice.

Second, this document aims to show its audience how to do what we did.
This guide provides a framework for the conceptualization and curation
of future literary exhibits. Through textual and visual aids, it
provides specific instructions on how to design and implement each
exhibit component and provides links to relevant resources.

It builds a framework. It incorporates principles of best practice. It is
aimed towards broadest use. Share resources. Show how this became that.
Invite peer-review – please find us in the repo and make contirubute to
this document so that we can collectively enhance our theory and
practices of digital and analogue curation.

**Structure**

The organizing principles of this document were derived from the NINCH
Guide to Best Practices. More generally, the logic of this document is
based upon the logical progression of the exhibit itself.

Follows the logic of curating an exhibit. Form planning the physical
space to the digital and analogue exhibit extensions. It incorporates
our times line. curation of the exhibit from the physical space to the
individual exhibit compoents contributed by the 507 collective. Some
projects span both physical and digital environments. Some projects
group naturally together and those I’ve grouped together.

This paper devotes a section to each individual project. It documents the methods and 
practices, providesinstructional media and resources, and reflects on its theoretical and
practical value to the exhibit and beyond. It includes a project
description and rationalization (why this project is usefual/valuable),
a workflow chart/map/list, list of resources (usually in the link box), a
link to the author’s work in the GitHub Repo or elsewhere, and a step-by-step guide.

**How to Use This Guide**

In order to meet the needs and expectations of at least two distinct audiences, this guide 
functions according to its two purposes: a process narrative and manual.

For exhibit visitors, it will make explicit the purpose and methods
informing the conceptualization and curation of the exhibit. It will
also make this audience aware of the digital extensions providing
opportunities for further learning and/or interaction. As such, it also
functions as a finding aid for artifacts featured in the Maltwood
Gallery and in diffuse digital environments. To view the finding aid as
a spreadsheet model, please see Appendix A.

For professionals interested in modeling their own exhibit, this is a
process-oriented approach to literary exhibit conceptualization and
curation. This guide will function as a both a reference tool and how-to
manual. It can simply function as a framework for future exhibits
pointing out relevant resources and materials, or it can be read closely
as a step-by-step instructional manual.

As such, this guide assumes some knowledge of scholarly or academic
principles such as …(archives, artefacts, history eg modernism, and the
values these practices embody). Further, it assumes some technological
competencies including…. In all areas it assumes its audience shares its
values of creating and sharing scholarship based on best-practices,
transparency, interoperability, collaboration, and open-access
resources.

It does not assume any specialist knowledge of exhibit curation,
literary criticism, digital curation or scholarship, encoding or
digitization, or of *Ulysses*. It is intended to be accessed (and useful)
to a broad range of audiences including librarians, cultural heritage
professionals, students, teachers, academics, and artists/writers.

The graphic visualizations are intended to represent data in a
meaningful way. Where needed, interpretative instructions are provided.

The video/audio embedded within the text aims to either display or
demonstrate the project it represents. It includes screen casts,
instructional videos, and audio files, data graphs or charts, concept
maps, etc.

##Discussion and Conclusion 
In process

## Surprises, Issues, and Questions

1.	Beyond a general acknowledgments section in the introduction of my
paper, how should I manage citations? In some cases, I may might copy
and paste statements from logs. Is that ok? Most often, I imagine I’ll
need to paraphrase your work to create a sense of narrative unity. In
these cases, how should I reference your work? I do not see traditional
intext citations as a ‘friendly’ medium for this particular audience.
Endnotes are a possibility though not ideal. I propose including a link
from the section examining your project to your GitHub repo. Is this a
sufficient citation method? 

2.	It’s a challenge to envision how this document will be used and by whom. Who do you 
imagine the audience to be? If people don’t know it exists, how will they find it? 
In terms of genre, what would you expect from this document? Structure? Elements?
Tone? What would be informative? 

3. What kind visualizations would you add (for your project and possibly others)? Which 
element/process of your project would you like to see visualized? 

4.	A recurring challenge/issue I’m encountering is how to make this paper documenting 
the Long Now of *Ulysses* endure beyond the exhibit content. Is DH the common framework to 
get content out and let the methods speak for themselves?
